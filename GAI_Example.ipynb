This book includes delightful stories of those around Deming who influenced his work and helped create the foundation for agile and DevOps.\"\\n\\n—Jim Whitehurst, Senior Advisor at IBM\\n\\n“John Willis has looked deep into Dr. Deming’s history and teachings and profoundly explains his profound knowledge. Read this book and you will understand like never before the wisdom and sound advice of Dr. Deming.”\\n\\n—Jeffrey K. Liker, author of The Toyota Way\\n\\n“John Willis has crafted a delightful and insightful book that brings to life the personal story of W. Edwards Deming and how he created a tremendous impact in the world through his theory of profound knowledge. In this book, you\\'ll go beyond the theory and principles to discover the human experience that has led to some of the greatest organizational successes in the past century. Deming’s Journey to Profound Knowledge is a must-read for any student of Lean, Agile, quality, the Toyota Production System, and continuous improvement— or any leader who seeks to create a culture of excellence in their organization.” —Katie Anderson, author of Learning to Lead, Leading to Learn\\n\\n“John has read everything available about Deming and has woven the many threads of Dr. Deming’s life into a work of love. The result is a very pleasant fable that will prompt the novice reader to want to know more.

A word from his Irish-American mother, Virginia, who grew up in an Italian neighborhood. The word doesn’t translate exactly to English but is used as a term of endearment for a loved one. He earned the nickname while growing up on Long Island, hanging out in bars, and playing music until he made his way in the world. A moniker given to him by one of the legions of American women who went to work during World War II. During that time, she, like W. Edwards Deming—or simply Ed, as he was known among colleagues—was part of one of the most innovative eras in manufacturing history. So, perhaps this book is not just merely a coincidence but an act of fate.\\n\\nThe term Botchagalupe or Baciagaloop (a slang term in the Italian- American vernacular) was likely inspired by Charles Bacigalupo, an undertaker near the little Five Points area of Manhattan. Not many knew much of old Charlie, but he was credited for burying thousands of people at his own expense and saving them from an anonymous grave at Potter’s Field. He was also respon- sible for the internment of many more famous clients, including Ulysses S. Grant. But outside of his own community, very few people knew who he was. It’s perhaps no coincidence that my friend John Willis, a.k.a. Botchagalupe, is his namesake.\\n\\nMy path first crossed with John when I was working as an executive at a venture-backed startup that provided systems management software. John was starting to blog, touching on many topics that interested me. I fortuitously reached out to him and that, in turn, spawned one of the most valuable and long-lasting professional friendships of my life. I also started an informal apprenticeship with “Professor Botchagalupe.”\\n\\nJohn was a bit my senior and had already had a successful career in tech by this time, but his experience was very conventional. He was fascinated by the fairly new phenomena (at least at that time) of blogging, open source soft- ware, and social media, all things that were as foreign to him as the culture of Japan was to Ed. Though unlike many of his contemporaries who simply dismissed these new ways to communicate, Botchagalupe dove in headfirst. He was blogging most days and digging into the new technology around the cloud with a beginner’s mind. His lack of ego allowed him to easily make friends with\\n\\nleaders of one of the most transformative technology advancements in the twenty-first century: cloud computing.\\n\\nVery early in our friendship, I noticed he was like a bulldog: stubborn and unrelenting when something attracted his attention, interested in what made things tick, and eternally curious. I realized he was a lifelong learner, interested in how systems worked and what made them better. We spent the next few years running into each other at tech conferences, where I often found him deep in conversation with entry-level folks as well as CEOs. Learning and ask- ing questions.\\n\\nBefore long he had a job at Canonical, a company founded by a South Afri- can billionaire, Mark Shuttleworth, whose previous company, Thawte, had been acquired by Verisign to create the world’s largest web certificate security company. This gave John a front-row seat to the beginnings of cloud comput- ing. During this time, we spent many hours discussing the best way to author and deliver cloud computing systems. John, like Ed, is a systems nerd.\\n\\nDuring many business trips, over a beer or glass of whisky, I got to know John and realized that nothing made him more irate than systems that weren’t optimized. He often pointed out the flaws in systems he encountered and would complete a root-cause analysis. He would, in intricate detail, point out to me and others the problems in the Knight Capital high-frequency trading platform and how their company’s systems were flawed, resulting in a loss of $460 million in only forty-five minutes. Probably the most dramatic and preventable loss in stock market history. That’s my friend John, a systems geek, a student of history, and eventually a teacher of thousands of developers and operations folks.\\n\\nOver the years, I have watched John, who, as he’d readily admit, was no spring chicken. Still, he ran shoulder-to-shoulder with the “young turks” in the tech startup world. He has been an executive at startups that were acquired by Dell Technologies and others. Another startup was acquired after only a few months by Docker, a Silicon Valley darling, which gained unicorn status ($1 bil- lion valuation) in record time. All the while, he was looking for the same system of knowledge in IT that mirrored the success Ed had seen with his System of Profound Knowledge in manufacturing.\\n\\nJohn’s pursuit led him to one of the biggest trends in IT these days, the cultural movement among technologists called DevOps: an idea that better com- munication and culture between teams could and would provide better results. A culture that, while not exactly in sync with the Japanese worker, shared many similarities. Today, John, along with a small group of others, such as Patrick Debois, Andrew Clay Shafer, Damon Edwards, and Gene Kim, are easily credited with starting this movement, which has become a $7 billion industry and will continue to grow at 20% year over year for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nFOREWORD\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xii\\n\\nDuring many of his trips to and from conferences, John and I would speak on the phone. By some odd coincidence, it seemed that it was always as he was about to enter a cab. He knew that cab drivers preferred to be paid in cash and he preferred to pay with a credit card. I would run out of fingers counting the times I heard him ask, “Do you take credit cards?” I never heard the responses, but I would soon hear a door slam, and he would indicate he was riding to the airport. Often, as he arrived and handed the cabbie a credit card, a fight would ensue, and the cab driver would refuse his card. Many times, I’d end up listening from his pocket at the heated exchange, normally ending with, “If you can’t take the card, then I guess you won’t get paid. Please feel free to call the authorities.”\\n\\nThis anecdote is worth noting for two reasons. First, it was a strange coin- cidence that this happened so frequently. Second, it was typical of a system being so irreplaceably broken, and that was something my friend couldn’t abide. Luckily for John’s blood pressure, Uber and Lyft came along and showed that systems that are broken will be upended by better systems.\\n\\nAfter I read the manuscript for this book, I felt that it would be a disservice for someone to read about W. Edwards Deming, a soft-spoken expert in the most important advances in his century, without knowing a little more about the author. John Willis is also a relatively quiet voice in one of this century’s biggest advancements. I find that this book has not only captured the essence of how to improve most any business, with a nod to quality and understand- ing of the human beings that are responsible for that quality, but also gives a portrait of the hard-working, humble man from Wyoming who helped revolu- tionize manufacturing in Japan and around the world.\\n\\n—Mark Hinkle\\n\\nFOREWORD\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xiii\\n\\nPreface\\n\\nI pulled on a thread and found a fascinating tapestry.\\n\\nMy professional career started in 1980, just as New York was coming out of one of the worst financial times since the Great Depression. The joke was you couldn’t get a job with IBM, J.P. Morgan, or Grumman without inheriting it. So, at just nineteen years old, I headed to Texas to get in on the oil boom. I had only a duffle bag and my incredibly efficient and reliable 1975 Toyota Corolla. During my first week in Texas, I found a job with Exxon Corporation as a computer programmer in exploration and research. The eighties were a fasci- nating time to work at Exxon, which had a rich culture of leadership and best practices. Although I couldn’t have known it at the time, Exxon’s leadership was my first introduction to Dr. Deming’s principles. Working with some of the world’s top geophysicists, I was indoctrinated in the principles of systems thinking and the scientific method. These principles would shape not only the successes of my life but those of some of the greatest organizations in the world. A decade later, I went to work at GE. As I earned my Six Sigma* Green Belt, I had no idea that what I was doing came directly from Dr. Deming’s teachings. GE had its own analytical statistics department. It seemed like my entire job revolved around control charts, a Deming hallmark. The core lessons I learned around cooperation, experimentation, and systems thinking—all rooted in Deming’s teachings—deeply resonated with me as I continued my career path. While I had unknowingly learned much of his teachings, my knowledge of Dr. W. Edwards Deming didn’t begin until the 2000s. I had started work- ing with best-selling author and award-winning CTO Gene Kim in 2009 on The DevOps Handbook, along with coauthors Jez Humble and Patrick Debois. Before joining the project, Gene had asked me to read The Goal by supply chain management guru Eliyahu Goldratt. After absorbing it, I quickly read his other books: The Theory of Constraints, Critical Chain, It’s Not Luck, and Necessary but Not Sufficient. Let’s just say that after reading his books I was all in on Goldratt. At a DevOps Days conference in 2011, my friend and mentor Ben Rock- wood, a pioneer in internet engineering, was running an open discussion on Goldratt. During the discussion, Ben intimated that Goldratt was heavily influenced by someone called William Edwards Deming. I didn’t know who the\\n\\nA methodology for continuous process improvement.\\n\\nguy was, and I wasn’t looking forward to learning about someone who might shake my faith in Goldratt. But true to his nature, Ben challenged me to at least read Deming’s 14 Points for Management.\\n\\nWhen I did, I was floored. I realized that almost everything Deming was saying was the foundation for the three major software movements I’d experi- enced in my life: Lean software development, Agile development, and DevOps. What amazed me even more was the fact that Deming had written his 14 Points in the 1980s, years before these software movements occurred.\\n\\nOver the next few years, I came to be heavily influenced by the “Prophet of Quality,” as he’s often known. The more I learned about him, the more I wanted to know. It seemed like every little thread I pulled revealed more and more of just how fascinatingly complex the man’s life and thinking were.\\n\\nDuring the course of coauthoring Beyond The Phoenix Project with Gene Kim in 2017, I stepped up my research on Deming. I wanted to truly understand how he’d come to the epiphanies that seemed to predict organizational success or failure in nearly any organization or system. What events littered along his life’s path helped him discover the universal System of Profound Knowledge? I felt that to understand Deming’s philosophy, it was critical to understand the roots and catalysts of his ideas. I’ve spent over a decade learning about Deming’s life and teachings, and I’ve become something of an expert in the process. To this day, I still find myself peeling back the layers of Deming’s onion as I learn more about those who influenced him, such as the scientists and phi- losophers C. I. Lewis, Percy Williams Bridgman, and Bertrand Russell.\\n\\nUnfortunately, of the more than two dozen books about Deming I have read, none chronicle how specific events and inspirations in his life directly connect with the four elements of Profound Knowledge. They were either biographies or explanations about how to apply his principles. None told the journey of how his ideas were developed.\\n\\nI decided that was the book I needed to write, a book that connected the unique moments in Deming’s life that culminated in his grand unifying theory of management that is the predictor of success or failure in every organization today: the System of Profound Knowledge\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, I finally found the opportunity to sit down and write. Before the pandemic, I typically traveled about two hundred thousand miles a year. But with lockdown, I suddenly had an extra fifty hours a month of prime productivity time.\\n\\nThey say if you really want to know a subject, write a book about it. That’s certainly been true for me. I only thought I knew about Deming before. But pulling on the multiple threads of his life has given me profound respect for his thinking, accomplishments, and influence. He is like a cross between Albert\\n\\nPREFACE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xvi\\n\\nEinstein and Forrest Gump: seemingly always in the right place at the right time but brilliant enough to take what he sees and experiences and use it to change the world around him. What’s more, the stories about the lives of those surrounding him were wonderfully entertaining and insightful. I wanted to write a book that captured the full picture of his life and his influence, a sys- tems-thinking portrait instead of a book hyperfocused on a singular piece of the whole. After all, systems thinking is one of the four elements of Profound Knowledge (as you’ll learn about later).\\n\\nOne of my favorite authors is Michael Lewis. When reading Moneyball, for example, you think you’re reading a book about baseball statistics, but by the time you finish, you find that you’ve read a biography of Billy Beane. Similarly, while this book may look like a biography of Deming, it’s the story behind the story of his masterwork, which he shared with the world when he was nine- ty-three years old. Imagine publishing your magnum opus at that age, just before your death. That gives you a clue as to the kind of man you’re dealing with.\\n\\nIn Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods, you read not only the chronicles of his hike through the Appalachian Trail but also stories of history, scandals, fed- eral agencies, and the tire warehouse that’s been burning for decades. Similarly, this book tells the untold stories of those in Deming’s life, from a survivor of Japanese oppression who was the catalyst for Deming’s coming to Japan to Doris Quinn heading quality education at MD Anderson Cancer Center and helping Deming with his theory of psychology. These untold stories provide additional insight into Deming’s discovery of Profound Knowledge.\\n\\nWhile Deming’s influence is far and wide, it is most directly visible in four major nationwide efforts: the Aberdeen Proving Grounds (trying to out- manufacture the Axis powers during World War II), the Japanese Economic Miracle (their economic recovery after World War II), the American quality rev- olution of the 1980s, and, most recently, in the race to develop and distribute vaccines for COVID-19.\\n\\nAs we look to what’s next, you will find we need Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge to face one of the biggest threats to the world today: cyberterrorism. The last four chapters of this book deal with understanding the severity of the cyber crisis and how Deming can save us yet again.\\n\\nI’ve enjoyed the journey of bringing this book to you, and I hope you enjoy\\n\\nthis labor of love.\\n\\n—John “Botchagalupe” Willis Auburn, Alabama September 2022\\n\\nPREFACE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xvii\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nWhat Ed Said\\n\\nThe black-and-white clip playing across the tiny screen shows the aftermath of a bitter conflict. A literal war zone. A city of millions reduced to rubble and ashes. Half its population lost. The caption reads: “TOKYO, 1945.”\\n\\nIn the summer of 1980, when that clip aired on TV, Kevin Cahill was a twenty-year-old boy living with his grandparents in Washington, DC. He’d come back to DC to work before he began his sophomore year at UCLA.\\n\\nKevin had been perplexed by a phone call from his mother weeks earlier. She could barely contain her excitement as she proudly told him that his grand- father was to appear in a prime-time NBC News special. Kevin’s grandfather had always shunned the spotlight, so she extracted a promise from Kevin that he would make his grandfather watch it.\\n\\nBut why? Why would millions of people be interested in my quiet, gentle, hard-working grandfather? he wondered.1 When he asked his grandfather directly, all Kevin got were polite deflections and a quick change of subject. The man was generally quiet and reserved but not downright secretive.\\n\\nThe special episode’s name didn’t help explain his grandfather’s involve- ment: “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?” On the other hand, anyone who heard the episode’s name knew exactly what it was about: the Japanese takeover of American industry.\\n\\nThe Tarnish of the Golden Age\\n\\nWhereas the rest of the industrialized nations of the world lay in ruins after World War II, the US was left virtually untouched. As the only game in town, US industry reigned supreme. Factories couldn’t churn out cars, radios, and other manufactured goods fast enough. Quality wasn’t a concern. The only real challenge was keeping up with global demand.\\n\\nAmerica entered what is commonly referred to as the “Golden Age* of Cap- italism.” From 1948 to about 1970, the nation ruled supreme. Its economy, manufacturing sectors, military, and ability to shape history and world politics were second to none. It was a heady time to call yourself an American.\\n\\nWell, a golden age for the “average Joe” and decidedly not for women, people of color, and\\n\\nother minorities.\\n\\nThe seventies knocked the US off its pedestal. The USSR dominated the 1972 Munich Olympics, whereas the US went home nearly empty-handed. Despite Nixon proclaiming Vietnam a success, the prolonged war and withdrawal demoralized the military and America itself. A few months later, the 1973 oil crisis, engineered by a handful of developing countries, brought the most power- ful nation on earth to a halt. And finally, the Iranian hostage crisis embarrassed the US on a global stage. Nationalistic feelings of pride, superiority, and modern manifest destiny had given way to uncertainty, anger, and fear.\\n\\nAnd Japan . . . Outside observers called it the Japanese economic miracle, and for good reason. Upon its surrender to the Allied Forces in 1945, Japan was a ghost of its former self, its people on the brink of starvation. A significant portion of its industrial capacity had been wiped out. Not only had the entire country been bombed to nearly nothing, but it didn’t have the means to rebuild. What mea- ger production it could muster was of such low quality that “Made in Japan” became a joke the world over.\\n\\nAfter the war, the US stayed in Japan to oversee the dismantling of the Japanese military. From 1945 to 1952 the US’s mission in Japan was simply to help it survive. It wasn’t until US policy shifted in 1947 (known as the Reverse Course) that Japan began to rebuild itself. The US brought in several experts to advise the new Japanese government and what little remained of its industry. By 1968, just twenty-three years after the country had been decimated, no one laughed when the island nation surpassed West Germany to become the largest economy in the world after the US, a position it would hold for over forty years.\\n\\nBy the seventies, the phrase “Made in Japan” conjured images of advanced technologies, the best electronics, the most reliable appliances, and the high- est-quality cars. The oil crisis spurred many Americans to buy foreign cars over domestic. With better gas mileage, greater dependability, and superior engi- neering and craftsmanship, a Toyota topped a Ford, GM, or Chrysler in every way. The land of Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller was no longer the manu- facturing capital of the world.\\n\\nAmericans could tolerate losing the battle for electronics and just about everything else, but Americans have a special relationship with cars. You can almost hear the average Joe muttering, “Well, at least we still have our cars.” Losing dominance in the manufacturing of cars, it seems, was the final straw (or the wake-up call, depending on how you looked at it). That’s when the everyday, red-blooded American realized the country was in trouble.\\n\\nHow had this happened? How had “Made in Japan” gone from joke to jug- gernaut? How had the once vanquished country come to usurp its conqueror?\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xx\\n\\nIt was astonishing. It was impossible. It was nothing short of a miracle. From business leaders to politicians to factory floor hands, everyone shared the same bewilderment. They began to ask the question: If Japan can do it, why can’t the US?\\n\\nAnd for Kevin, the question was, What did my grandfather have to do with\\n\\nany of this?\\n\\nThe Miracle Maker\\n\\nOn the day “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?” was to air, Kevin dutifully went to the cramped basement of his grandparents’ little brownstone. There sat his grandfather, almost eighty years old, at his desk working with the vigor and determination of someone a fraction of his age.\\n\\nBeing the voracious reader and lifelong learner he was, it’s possible Kevin’s grandfather had that day’s edition of The Washington Post with the op-ed that read:\\n\\nHave you looked at the economic news lately and wondered who really did win World War II?\\n\\nSomebody at NBC News evidently did, and came up with “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?”—an “NBC White Paper” on Japan’s burgeoning productivity and our lagging one—to be aired tonight at 9:30 on Chan- nel 4.\\n\\nIt is a thoughtful, often depressing and sometimes fascinating examination of what makes and maintains a work ethic, and why we may end up freezing to death in the dark but the Japanese won’t.2\\n\\nKevin and his grandfather climbed the narrow, rickety staircase to join his grandmother and great-aunt around the tiny TV. The program began with the aforementioned black-and-white clip of the ruins of Tokyo in 1945, followed by another black-and-white clip from the formal surrender of Japan. Next, the screen showed an industrial smelter pouring liquid metal with the caption “TOKYO, 1980.” Then the images on the screen flipped in rapid succession, showing scenes of busy factories and electronics labs, automated robots and cars rolling off assembly lines—the very images that might spring to mind whenever anyone mentioned Japan in the 1980s. Then the overlay of the epi- sode’s title: “IF JAPAN CAN . . . Why Can’t We?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Kevin’s grandfather, Dr. William Edwards Deming, appeared on the screen. In his quiet, measured tone, he asked, “What can we do to work smarter—not harder?”\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xxi\\n\\nWhile the other people watching nearly burst with pride, Kevin’s grandfa- ther seemed embarrassed. He made as if to go back to his basement office to keep working, but his family cajoled him into watching the rest.\\n\\nNearly halfway through the program, there had been no further mention of Deming. It was “an uncomfortable thirty minutes,” as Kevin would later note.3\\n\\nThen came a Japanese manager giving a speech . . .\\n\\nProductivity gains were taught to us by Americans. We are very fortu- nate to have America as a good teacher and we always try to be a very good student, and that’s what made it possible for us to be somewhat competitive in an international market with US industries.4\\n\\nAt the words “somewhat competitive,” the audience began to laugh. The speaker—Joji Arai, manager of the Japan Productivity Center—was being modest and humble. At this time, Japanese manufacturers outclassed their US counterparts to the point it was laughable. Literally.\\n\\nThe next cutaway changed everything. One second, laughter at Mr. Arai’s understatement of the century. The next, a slow, solitary voice that everyone around the TV knew well: “The first time that I went there to teach industry, I taught four hundred-and-fifty engi- neers in several cities. Tokyo, Nagoya, and Fukuoka . . . ”5\\n\\nAs the screen showed clips of the family’s beloved, gentle giant smiling and shaking hands with Japanese executives, the voiceover of narrator-reporter Lloyd Dobyns explained:\\n\\nW. Edwards Deming first went to Japan in 1950 to teach industrial pro- ductivity through statistical analysis. He was so successful that Japan’s annual award for productivity is called “the Deming Prize.” It is one of the most coveted awards in Japan and the medal that goes with the award is a profile of Dr. Deming—an American.\\n\\n. . . We have said several times that much of what the Japanese are doing is what we taught them to do. And the man who did most of the teaching is W. Edwards Deming.6\\n\\nSome say this NBC special was the beginning of the quality revolution in America. At the very least, it brought the topic from the fringes to the main- stream. In just seventy-five minutes, it upended how the US and the world saw business and industry, sparking a wholesale adoption of Japanese methods and management. It dispelled many of the myths and misunderstandings surround- ing the Japanese economic miracle and revealed one of its miracle makers.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xxii\\n\\nNo sooner had the documentary concluded than the telephone began\\n\\nto ring.\\n\\nFor Kevin’s grandfather, life was never quite the same after that.\\n\\nHistory Repeats Itself\\n\\nFor the next thirteen years, Ed (as he was called by those close to him) traveled from coast to coast, delivering lectures on productivity and management. Ford, GM, Xerox, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, The New York Times—it seemed everyone wanted a seat at the feet of “the master.”\\n\\nBut history has a funny way of repeating itself. The lectures he gave were almost the same ones he’d delivered thirty years prior in Japan in the 1950s . . . and in the US back in the 1940s.\\n\\nYes, Ed had been down this road forty years ago, right after the US joined the fight against the Axis Powers in World War II. At that time, the country had to ramp up its industrial production of everything. From battleships and bombers to boots and bandages, the Allied Powers needed as much as possible as fast as possible, and there could be no compromise on quality. A defective washing machine meant drying the clothes on the line; a jammed gun might mean death.\\n\\nThe Allies didn’t win because of D-day or the atomic bomb. The Axis pow- ers didn’t lose because of a misstep or overreaching. Victory came because the US outproduced the rest of the world. They achieved this despite the absence of millions of skilled American workers and experienced managers, who were on the front lines. It’s no stretch to say that the Allies won because of the quality produced by Rosie the Riveter. Rosie out-manufactured her male predecessors. And she did this using something called statistical process control (SPC).\\n\\nStarting at Stanford University during the war, Deming trained over two thousand people in statistical process control methods. They, in turn, taught thirty thousand additional trainers. These thousands upon thousands of sta- tistical process control evangelists went forth and spread the gospel, as it were, to Rosie’s supervisors and Rosie herself. The Allies won because of Rosie, and Rosie’s stunning success had Deming’s fingerprints all over it.\\n\\nThen GI Joe came home and once again donned his business suit or factory coveralls. He took one look at how the war was won and said, “Forget all that— we’re going back to the way we’ve always done it.”\\n\\nIt took over thirty years to realize the mistake in throwing out Deming’s\\n\\nteachings.\\n\\nIn the NBC special, Lloyd Dobyns said of Deming, “In his own country he is not widely recognized.”7 After the war, Deming had been shunned by his own\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xxiii\\n\\ncountrymen. He looked elsewhere for eager students . . . and there was no one more eager than the Japanese.\\n\\nThe Story of Profound Knowledge\\n\\nSo what exactly had Deming done in Japan? How did he bring about the economic miracle that had the US on its knees? He shared a collection of fundamental truths that show how any system or process can be transformed into something greater, what he would later call the System of Profound Knowledge.\\n\\nEd began his journey as a mathematical physicist right at the time Ein- stein’s and others’ theories about the nature of the universe were coming into vogue. This gave Ed an appreciation for the complexity of reality and was a clue that eventually put him onto one piece of Profound Knowledge, an apprecia- tion for systems.\\n\\nIn his thirties, Ed found a mentor, Dr. Walter Shewhart, who introduced him to pragmatism and a theory of knowledge. Essentially, this school of thought approached the world via the scientific method, constantly testing ideas and reevaluating hypotheses.\\n\\nShewhart also grounded Deming in a theory of variation. In his work with physics, Deming already knew that the very nature of reality is random. From Shewhart, Ed solidified his thinking around variation, seeing randomness as inherent to any system or process, from stuffing envelopes to predicting radio- active isotope decay. Variability is a fact of life.\\n\\nAfter World War II ended, Ed traveled to Japan to help with nationwide rebuilding efforts. By this time, he was well grounded in three pieces of Pro- found Knowledge: knowledge, variation, and systems thinking. But it was in Japan that he gained an appreciation for the final cornerstone of Profound Knowledge: a theory of psychology. In the Japanese, Ed found a culture of inherent respect between manager and employee. In truth, Japan influenced Ed as much as Ed influenced Japan.\\n\\nFor instance, Toyota’s world-class approach to business—called the Toyota Way—is a beautiful fusion of Eastern and Western ideas, bringing together and bringing out the best in both. By this time, Japan was an economic juggernaut, and American businesses were eager to learn from their Eastern counterparts. In his eighties, Ed was finally getting his due.\\n\\nJust after he passed away in 1993, Deming’s book The New Economics was published. In it, he presented his masterwork, the culmination of his life’s experiences. He brought together all four pieces of Profound Knowledge and named it the System of Profound Knowledge (SoPK).\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xxiv\\n\\nDeming’s System of Profound Knowledge encompasses four elements and includes fourteen points of management and seven deadly diseases of management.\\n\\nThese four elements of Profound Knowledge are:\\n\\n1. A Theory of Knowledge: How do we know what we believe we know? 2. A Theory of Variation: How do we analyze and understand what we\\n\\nknow?\\n\\n3. A Theory of Psychology: How do we account for human behavior? 4. An Appreciation of Systems/Systems Thinking: Are we seeing the\\n\\nbigger picture?\\n\\nArmed with this lens—these four ways of seeing the world—any person or entity can achieve transformational change in any system or process. In other words, this lens is a proven way to make the world a better place.\\n\\nAnd as Deming said, these four elements are not something he made up. Rather, they are fundamental truths that he discovered along his life’s path, just like the Theory of Gravity or the Theory of Relativity.\\n\\n—\\n\\nFrom the balance of power in the US Capitol to NASCAR racing and globaliza- tion, the ripples of his work seem almost endless. While his story is fascinating by itself, this book isn’t strictly about his life. Rather, it’s the story of the gift he gave the world: a way of thinking that can be applied to any facet of life or work. When Ed worked with Ford Motor Company, he didn’t try to fix specific problems, although he often did in the course of his true aim: to embed the System of Profound Knowledge in the minds of everyone who worked there. Ed’s mission was to work himself out of a job. He wanted to equip the people inside the company with the tools they needed to profoundly change the way Ford worked.\\n\\nWhen he stood before the collective remaining industrial base of Japan in 1950, he didn’t try to fix individual companies’ problems. He taught them principles and gave them a different way of thinking about the work they did each day. He didn’t want them to change their practices so much as he wanted to change their mindsets.\\n\\nIt was the same with American manufacturers during World War II. It wasn’t enough that everyone pulled together to create as many war supplies as possible. The workforce and entire business had significantly changed, requiring a massive shift in how they operated day to day. The same thing\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xxv\\n\\nhappened forty years later: the American economy had profoundly changed, requiring a change in how organizations operated.\\n\\nDeming’s System of Profound Knowledge is about learning how to bring about profound change on your own. That’s why, even three decades after his death, we’re still using his teachings as we head into the unknowns of the future.\\n\\nI’m a software developer: I can tell you horror stories about cyberterrorists in the Digital Wild West. We’ve never before faced what we are facing today, and we need help figuring out how to deal with it. I and millions of others use Ed’s methods to arrive at profound insights we otherwise would have never found on our own.\\n\\nThis book chronicles not only the arc of Ed’s life but that of his thinking as well. The roots of the System of Profound Knowledge began even before he was born and reached a beautiful culmination right at the time he went to college. Had he been born a few years earlier, I’m not sure he would have been as\\n\\nexposed to a new kind of thinking (quantum physics) as he was.\\n\\nHad he not been raised in a hardscrabble life and interned at the cut- ting-edge social experiment that was Hawthorne Works, I don’t know that his system would have been as humane and human centered as it came to be.\\n\\nHad he not taken a job as a mathematical physicist, he might not have had the opportunity to learn from the world’s foremost expert on variation and how it shows up in absolutely every facet of existence.\\n\\nHad he not been an expert in statistical surveys, he wouldn’t have had the opportunity to travel to Japan, and especially not at the crucial moment of a devastated and demoralized country trying to rebuild its economy, looking for hope and inspiration.\\n\\nThis book is truly about how the lens of Profound Knowledge was found. It just so happens that its discoverer was a man called Ed.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009xxvi\\n\\nPart I\\n\\nFoundations of Profound Knowledge\\n\\nTo understand the System of Profound Knowledge,\\n\\nwe must first look at the foundational elements\\n\\nthat formed Deming’s early thinking.\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nHumble Origins & Non-Determinism\\n\\nEinstein possessed a form of intelligence that moved beyond normal ways of formal thinking, and in doing so he often disturbed the drowsy status quo. Dr. Deming was also one of those disturbers, one of the leaders of the “monkey wrench gang.” And like Einstein, he was one of the gifted few who had the courage to tell the emperor the truth about his new clothes.\\n\\n—Frank Voehl, Deming: The Way We Knew Him\\n\\nDeming’s Humble Beginnings\\n\\nDeming’s one childhood claim to fame was when Buffalo Bill recognized him in the crowd during a performance of “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show” outside Los Angeles where “Edwards,” as his family called him, was visiting his cousins. The notoriously flamboyant showman knew the boy from Cody, Wyoming, by sight if not by name.\\n\\nBuffalo Bill was arguably the most world-famous living American at the time, having extensively toured the US and then Europe, performing before Queen Victoria herself twice. His act made him not only famous but rich.\\n\\nBut Buffalo Bill wanted to be taken seriously as a legitimate businessman instead of a circus act. He used his money and influence in an enterprise to create the largest undertaking of its kind ever attempted in the West: using irrigation to create an agricultural empire stretching along the Shoshone River. He began by incorporating a small town in 1896 about fifty miles east of Yellowstone National Park, which Colonel William Frederick “Buffalo Bill” Cody humbly named after himself.\\n\\nLife in and around Cody, Wyoming, revolved around Bill, and Bill was usually in and around “the sweetest hotel that ever was.”1 Named after his daughter, the Irma Hotel not only housed travelers but served as Bill’s head- quarters, comprising two personal suites and his professional offices.\\n\\nHis hotel was, in effect, the heart of his endeavor. When he built it, he envisaged something akin to an African city serving as a staging point for safari expeditions, perhaps like Zanzibar or Mombasa. He foresaw hosting European nobility hunting big game, East Coast financiers looking for poten- tial investments, and opportunists from everywhere investigating the mining\\n\\nand ranching possibilities. The bread and butter of the Irma, however, would be the promised flood of newcomers flocking to settle the soon-to-be-verdant plains around Cody.\\n\\nShortly after the Irma opened in 1902, the Demings arrived from Sioux City, Iowa. The thirty-three-year-old father, William, had been trained as a law clerk but now sought to make his fortune on the frontier. He arranged for temporary employment with an attorney in Cody, then moved his wife and two toddling boys from the breadbasket of America to the barren badlands of Wyoming. The town was still in its infancy. There wasn’t enough legal work to keep the young father employed full time, so he found a job at the Irma as a sort of jack-of-all-trades. In addition to his wages, the hotel provided him and his family with a small house on the grounds. Edwards and his brother became regular fixtures at the Irma.\\n\\nThus, Buffalo Bill recognized Edwards and his little brother at the LA\\n\\nperformance.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Buffalo Bill, the Cody-based irrigation empire failed. But in 1905, the federal government began a massive public works project via the US Reclamation Service aimed at irrigating ninety thousand acres to turn the semi- arid Bighorn Basin into fertile farms. This necessitated the construction of the Shoshone River Dam twenty-five miles northeast of Cody, around the settlement of Powell. Once completed, the concrete-arch gravity dam—itself a predecessor to the Hoover Dam—was the tallest dam in the world.\\n\\nThe area around Powell was opened to homesteaders, and, in 1906, Mr. William Deming applied for and received forty acres of farmland on the edge of town. Or at least what everyone hoped would be farmland one day. In the meantime, the Demings eked out what living they could out where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nDecades later, Ed recalled his family’s hardscrabble life. “Our house in Powell, roughly 1908 to 1912, was a tarpaper shack about the size of a freight car. . . . Electricity and indoor plumbing were out of the question. Snow blew in through the cracks in the door and in the windows.”2 He recollected own- ing a cat at the time that slept with him and his brother, keeping them warm at night.\\n\\nThe Shoshone River Dam (also known as Buffalo Bill Dam) was completed in 1910, but with or without irrigation, Deming’s father was never a successful farmer. He once remarked, “A farmer makes his money on the farm and spends it in town. An agriculturalist makes his money in town and spends it on the farm . . . . I’m an agriculturalist.”3\\n\\nThe eggs, milk, and vegetables that kept the family alive came from their chickens, cow, and garden. Despite their efforts, it wasn’t always enough. Late\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u20094\\n\\nin his life, Dr. Deming would recall his childhood. “I remember my mother, tak- ing my brother and me by the hand, prayed for food.”4 Elizabeth, his younger sister and the first baby born in Powell, later noted, “We didn’t have much, but nobody had anything.”5\\n\\nTo make ends meet, William continued to do some legal work in the area while Mrs. Pluma Deming, neé Edwards,* taught piano and voice lessons on her Steinway parlor grand piano. William later began traveling, selling real estate and insurance. Over time, his business grew enough that the Demings were able to move out of the little tar shack on the prairie and into a slightly better home.\\n\\nThough poor, his parents were well educated and poured their knowledge\\n\\n(and, perhaps, thirst for more) into their children.\\n\\nEdwards was raised in an atmosphere that included both left-brain and right-brain learning—his mother provided the right-brain perspective— the synthetic and creative aspects of learning . . . through music, while his father tended more toward the left-brain (cognitive) perspective. The atmosphere created by Deming’s parents served as the basis for his intellectual achievements and quite likely spurred the qualities which contributed to his success—an intense work ethic, devotion to spouse and family, a love of music.6\\n\\nThis environment set the course for Deming’s life. His hard-knocks upbringing gave him a unique perspective on the on-the-ground reality of the working class that managers—especially those from more privileged back- grounds—couldn’t appreciate. And the atmosphere his parents fostered helped him became a philomath: a lifelong learner and boundary spanner, a master of engineering and statistics in addition to a musician, composer, and linguist. This all resulted in a young man who was serious, studious, and diligent. The family even came to (prophetically) nickname him “the Professor.”\\n\\nNewton’s Apple and Schrödinger’s Cat Set the Stage\\n\\nThe year before the Demings moved from the Irma to the tar shack in Powell, a theoretical physicist published four groundbreaking papers that challenged the laws of physics (and would be instrumental in framing much of the thinking\\n\\nDeming was named William after his father; Edwards after his mother’s maiden name. Thus,\\n\\nWilliam Edwards Deming.\\n\\nCHAPTER 1: HUMBLE ORIGINS & NON-DETERMINISM\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u20095\\n\\nin Deming’s Profound Knowledge). One of the papers held the seeds of what would become the world’s most famous formula, E=mc2.\\n\\nBefore Einstein, everyone relied on Sir Isaac Newton’s explanations of how the physical world works (e.g., for every action there’s an equal and opposite reac- tion, objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force, etc.). Einstein showed the world that physics is more like the Korean DMZ: Newton’s laws applied only in certain jurisdictions. Past that border was a whole other world. That border was the atom, the basic building block of all matter.\\n\\nNewtonian physics governed the apple: If you drop it, it will fall to the ground. However, once you get to the quantum level, everything goes squirrely. You can’t be certain what subatomic particles will do. For example, from the subatomic perspective, if you drop an apple, it may or may not hit the ground. It’s enough to make your head hurt.\\n\\nOthers quickly built on Einstein’s work throughout the 1920s, includ- ing Niels Bohr (who later worked on the Manhattan Project) and Erwin Schrödinger. But these physicists’ discoveries were just pieces of a much bigger shift: the rise of non-determinism.\\n\\nBefore Einstein published his famous E=mc2, and his following Nobel prize for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, the world was seen through the lens of determinism (Newtonian Physics): “If I drop this apple, it will fall.” In simpler terms, the world operates solely on cause and effect.\\n\\nTake the weather, for instance. Decades ago, meteorologists believed that if they knew all the variables, such as humidity, wind direction, barometric pressure, etc., they could predict the weather with 100% accuracy. In fact, the earliest computers were created expressly for calculating all these variables. But even with the advances in technology we have today, meteorologists are never spot-on all the time. Even if we can calculate every variable, there’s still ran- domness, non-determinism.\\n\\nNon-determinism also has roots in Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution: If you cross a black cow with a black cow, the offspring will probably be another black cow . . . but a gene might mutate and result in a two-headed white calf. You just can’t ever be certain.\\n\\nThis is what physicist Max Planck (the father of quantum mechanics), Einstein, and others observed: No matter how much you know, there is an infinite amount of chance and randomness in the universe. Therefore, there can be no such thing as absolute certainty; the world is constantly in flux. This academic environment prepared Deming to pursue probability and statistics, a cornerstone to his Theory of Variation.\\n\\nNiels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg took this idea of infinite variability to its extreme with the Copenhagen interpretation, which states that a quantum\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u20096\\n\\nparticle does not exist in one state or another, but in all of its possible states at the same time.\\n\\nErwin Schrödinger gave us an easy way to understand how those two physicists saw the way the world works (the difference between deterministic thinking and non-deterministic thinking). Say you put a cat in a sealed box. Inside, there are two items. One is a can of poisonous gas. The other is a radio- active isotope giving off gamma rays. When the isotope decays and releases gamma rays, it triggers the poison gas. The cat dies.* The catch is you can’t predict when the isotope will decay.\\n\\nRadioactive decay can be random; no two isotopes decay at the same rate. It could decay in a minute or in a thousand years. Therefore, you’ll never know when the isotope in the box will decay, triggering the poisonous gas. According to Bohr and Heisenberg, since you can’t predict when the element will decay, you can never be sure at any given moment whether the cat is dead or alive. Until you open the box to see for yourself, you have to simultaneously assume that the cat is alive and that it’s dead. Schrödinger’s thought experiment here was to show the absurdity of those physicists’ extreme and extremely theoretical view. While this cat-in-the-box concept is funny, it illustrates how these two schools of thought differed. Determinism saw the world in black and white, cause and effect. With enough information, you could control any situation. Non-determinism sees the world in shades of gray. Everything has an element of randomness. Much of how the world works is unknowable. Mathematical formulas don’t always hold true; we can’t accurately predict the future. We can only speak in probabilities: “The apple will more than likely hit the ground, but we can’t say that with 100% certainty.”\\n\\nThis idea of non-determinism—that reality is inherently random—would form the basis of Deming’s worldview when he began his academic career. It taught him to see the world as a series of interconnected systems, sparking the beginning of his questioning knowledge and leading to the first element of the System of Profound Knowledge: How do we know what we know?\\n\\nMissing the Forest for the Trees\\n\\nLet’s look at a real-life example of non-determinism.\\n\\nPost–World War II, the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia had a serious malaria problem. In 1952, the World Health Organization (WHO) of the newly formed United Nations sent antimalarial experts to address the situation. One of the primary carriers of malaria is mosquitoes. Over the next three years, the\\n\\nNo cats were harmed in the making of this thought exercise, then or now.\\n\\nCHAPTER 1: HUMBLE ORIGINS & NON-DETERMINISM\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u20097\\n\\nWHO sprayed the chemical pesticide DDT on interior surfaces in the village longhouses, each of which housed about a hundred families. After malaria cases sharply declined, the WHO declared the mission accomplished and proceeded to host a world assembly in Mexico City to extol the virtues of DDT. Five years after the conference, Borneo started raining cats. Literally. And not just any cats. These were special cats: twenty-three rat catchers that floated down in their very own little cat parachutes from a British Royal Air Force transport plane.7 The cats’ mission: to replenish the island’s feline population. What happened to the native cats? As it turns out, DDT had killed more than mosquitoes.\\n\\nLater autopsies revealed that the WHO’s practices resulted in lethal amounts of DDT accumulating in cats. Without their natural predator, the rat population exploded. Rats don’t just eat crops; they carry diseases. In Bor- neo’s case, typhus and sylvatic plague (the same bacterium that caused the bubonic plague of Black Plague fame). Nature could reset the ratio of cats to rats elsewhere, perhaps, but Borneo is an island. If all the cats die, there are no more cats. To remedy the WHO’s mistake, the RAF flew twenty-three cats (plus three tons of food and supplies), blessed them to “go forth and multiply,” and let ’er rip.\\n\\nI imagine it was a carnival of carnivorous and carnal delight. The good folks at the WHO made an honest mistake. After all, the Western education system stresses analytical, deterministic thinking. In this case, it led to this line of reasoning:\\n\\n1. Malaria is bad in Borneo. 2. Malaria is carried by mosquitoes. 3. DDT kills mosquitoes. 4. Therefore, we should use DDT to kill the mosquitoes in Borneo.\\n\\nCats killing rats and therefore keeping typhus at manageable levels is what Donella Meadows, in Thinking in Systems, calls a balancing feedback loop.8 How- ever, when the cat population was out of balance, the natural order of things oscillated, creating what she describes as an overshoot of a reinforcing feed- back loop.9\\n\\nIf the WHO had embraced non-deterministic thinking, they would have taken a much wider view of the problem. The opposite of analytic thinking is systems thinking (a.k.a. appreciation of a system): the ability to see how one thing is part of a larger, connected system. Someone who approached the eco- system as a system might have thought along these lines:\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u20098\\n\\n1. Malaria is bad in Borneo. 2. Malaria is carried by mosquitoes. 3. DDT kills mosquitoes . . . but what else could it kill? 4. What else would spraying DDT on the inside of longhouses affect? 5. Do we have enough information to make an overall decision? 6. We should hold back until we can be reasonably sure we’re going to\\n\\nmake things better and not worse for the people of Borneo.\\n\\nThe WHO focused only on the immediate problem and failed to consider how one “solution” might trigger a chain reaction. They failed to see the whole system. This is exactly what I meant earlier about Profound Knowledge: profound change requires Profound Knowledge, and one of the tenets of Profound Knowl- edge is systems thinking, an ability to see the situation in its greater context.\\n\\nDeterminism and analytical thinking break down a problem into tiny pieces, whereas non-determinism and systems thinking look at a problem’s bigger picture.\\n\\nAnalytical thinkers say, “Mission accomplished. Now, let’s go home.” Systems thinkers say, “What were the results? Now, let’s make it even\\n\\nbetter.”\\n\\nThis was bleeding-edge thinking when a sixteen-year-old’s train rolled into\\n\\nLaramie, Wyoming. “The Professor” was going to college.\\n\\nThe Professor Becomes the Student\\n\\nEd, as he would come to introduce himself, was used to shouldering a heavy load. He expected things to be no different at the University of Wyoming. In fact, he decided to major in electrical engineering. Electricity at the time was still at the forefront of technological progress, so this was like majoring in arti- ficial intelligence or quantum computing today.\\n\\nAs he studied electrical engineering over the next four years, he supported himself by working as a janitor, shoveling snow, and cutting ice. He also cut rail- road ties and worked at a dry cleaner. At some point, he was a soda jerk serving up malted milkshakes.\\n\\nOn top of working and studying, he also sang in a church choir and played the piccolo in the university’s marching band. This blue-collar work ethic as well as his continued pursuit of service and the arts were a recurring pattern throughout his life. Ed was self-sufficient yet always found time to help those in need.\\n\\nEd graduated in four years but stayed for a fifth to study mathematics before enrolling at the University of Colorado for a master’s in physics and\\n\\nCHAPTER 1: HUMBLE ORIGINS & NON-DETERMINISM\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u20099\\n\\nmathematics. After he graduated with his master’s in 1924, one of his instruc- tors encouraged him to continue with his studies, perhaps at Yale. He moved to New Haven, where, three years later, he would earn his PhD in mathemat- ical physics, the basis of probabilities and statistics and the backbone of non- deterministic thinking.\\n\\nThe 1920s were an exciting time for scientific discovery. The year Ed received his PhD, the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics was held. The subject was electrons and photons. In attendance were some of the most famous names in science to this day, including Marie Curie, Edwin Schrödinger, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Werner Heisenberg. The conference spawned an explosion in scientific thought and discovery based on non-determinism.\\n\\nNon-determinism played a crucial role in shaping Deming’s worldview and began to lay the foundations for his System of Profound Knowledge. For one, it taught him that long-established and long-held beliefs weren’t necessarily true; the entire structure of the physical world was being rethought and reexamined. Second, it showed him that the underpinnings of our very existence are random. That idea of randomness would be born out through his fascination with statistics, which in turn would inform his understanding of variation (the second element in the System of Profound Knowledge).\\n\\nThird, it taught him to look beyond black-and-white cause and effect. It forced him to look at problems as multifaceted, complex systems, where chang- ing one factor might have far-reaching, and unintended, consequences. This was the beginnings of his understanding of the fourth element of Profound Knowledge: Systems Thinking.\\n\\nBut before we go forward, we need to rewind briefly. During the two sum- mers braketing Yale’s academic calendar, Ed Deming—a university faculty member with a bachelor’s in engineering, a master’s in physics and was work- ing on a PhD—supported himself and his wife (he’d married a schoolteacher, Agnes, in 1923), as ever, by working.\\n\\nThen, Ed took an internship in a Chicago sweatshop: Hawthorne Works.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200910\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nThe Jungle in Paradise\\n\\nThe supposition is prevalent the world over that there would be no problems in production or service if only our production workers would do their jobs in the way that they were taught. Pleasant dreams. The workers are handi- capped by the system, and the system belongs to the management.\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming, Out of the Crisis\\n\\nAll that remains of one of the greatest industrial sites in US history is a stone tower at the corner of Cicero Avenue and Cermak Road just outside Chicago. Few realize its “story is nothing less than the story of the rise and fall of urban industrial America in the twentieth century.”1\\n\\nIn the early 1900s, Hawthorne Works was a large factory complex of the Western Electric Company, producing large quantities of telephone equip- ment. But it was also the Silicon Valley of its time, a hub of innovation, the home of cutting-edge technology, and the object of national fascination. Haw- thorne Works played a crucial role in the history of manufacturing as well as in Deming’s own development, shaping the foundation of his ideas that would, decades later, change the world.\\n\\nHawthorne Works\\n\\nHard work was a fact of life in Rose Cihlar’s immigrant family. Although she was born in Chicago in 1903, her parents were born in Bohemia (before the region became part of the Czech Republic) and immigrated to the US shortly before the turn of the century. They settled down in the Czech-Slovak immi- grant community outside Chicago in Hawthorne (now swallowed up by the township of Cicero).\\n\\nWe don’t know when Rose began working, but we do know that in 1919 (making her sixteen years old at the time) Rose Cihlar worked as an assembly line inspector at a nearby factory. Just down the road sat Chicago’s famous meatpacking district, the subject of Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, published thir- teen years prior, which exposed the harsh working conditions and unsanitary environment of such sweatshops.\\n\\nHawthorne Works encompassed one hundred buildings and stretched over two hundred acres. It contained over five million square feet of workspace and was known as the Electrical Capital of America. By the time Rose worked there, Hawthorne had become the center of the next great technological advance- ment: the telephone.\\n\\nWhile the discovery of electricity a hundred years earlier was seen as magi- cal, the invention of telephony was seen as close to miraculous. Sure, lightbulbs were an upgrade from candles, but a telephone . . . well, there had never been anything like it. Before the telephone, if a beloved aunt went to live with family out West, you may not ever see or hear from her again; it wasn’t called the Wild West for nothing. You could write letters, but that was it. And it could take months for the letters to travel back and forth, or they might just get lost along the way.\\n\\nThe telephone, on the other hand, made it possible to pick up a device and hear your aunt’s voice instantly. You could have a conversation as if she were sitting across the table from you sharing a pot of coffee. It may seem trivial to us today, but it was nearly unimaginable for the average person at the time.\\n\\nToday, the city of Seattle stands for tech and coffee. Wall Street stands for finance. LA means movies. In the early 1900s, Pittsburgh as well as Gary, Indi- ana, stood for steel. Detroit was “Motor City.” And Hawthorne, Illinois, meant telephones.\\n\\nIn many ways, Hawthorne looked like a company town, like those of Henry Ford’s car factories or Milton Hershey’s chocolate factory. In the modern era, Phillips Petroleum had Bartlesville, Oklahoma. When I worked as a program- mer at Exxon in Houston in the eighties, the company seriously considered turning Conroe, Texas, into a company town. All workers who weren’t physi- cally needed at the pipelines and plants would be relocated to Conroe, complete with housing developments and planned communities. Hawthorne had its own power plant, hospital, fire department, trolley line, etc.\\n\\nUnlike the typical factory town, where every aspect of the workers’ lives was controlled by the company, at Hawthorne Works everything inside the factory belonged to Western Electric, the manufacturing division of American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), but everything outside the factory was pri- vately owned, privately financed, and privately organized. The employees even had their own sports teams, allowing Hawthorne Works to sponsor them. More importantly for Rose Cihlar, employees created their own savings and loans clubs to lend money to their peers to build their own homes and buy their own cars, allowing them to build personal wealth. No doubt this played an import- ant role in Rose’s ability to later send her son, Gene Cernan, to Purdue. Gene would go on to become commander of the final Apollo mission to the moon.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200912\\n\\nIn the typical company town, employees didn’t have power over their own lives and future. Workers were more or less dependent family members of a massive family business. A few patriarchs at the top dictated the lives of every- one else.\\n\\nThe difference at Hawthorne arose from Western Electric’s approach to its workers, an approach that was considered revolutionary at the time. Workers got not only vacations but paid vacations, not to mention retirement planning and company pensions. In many ways, the company treated its workers more like partners than peasants. It was a beautiful social experiment.\\n\\nAnd it worked. According to one source,\\n\\nYear after year, Hawthorne’s workers turned out an endless stream of complex communications apparatus, engineered by the sharpest minds in the field and assembled by skilled craftsmen. . . . In its time, Haw- thorne Works exemplified the “virtuous circle”: a win-win proposition whereby corporate success forged a bond of loyalty with its employees.2\\n\\nThere was a sense of community and identity. Employees didn’t merely work on assembly lines. They built the telephones that connected the nation. The factory existed for a decade before the first successful transcontinental phone call was made between San Francisco and New York in 1915. The work- ers of Hawthorne understood the significance of the work that came out of their factory—and they were a part of it. And so too was W. Edwards Deming. Deming experienced this esprit de corps firsthand while he interned at Haw- thorne Works during the summers of 1925 and 1926. Though he wouldn’t fully appreciate it until after he left, the factory was a testing ground for his Theory of Knowledge (one of the four elements of his System of Profound Knowledge) and was led by the creator behind the Theory of Variation. Crucially, his time at Haw- thorne gave Ed an appreciation for how human psychology affected a system.\\n\\nThe entire operation at Hawthorne was a masterwork of systems think- ing. Without his internship at Hawthorne, who knows how different history would have been? Decades later, he would find the same kind of relationship between Japanese companies and their workers. There was a profound sense of pride. The workers at Toyota weren’t making just rivets and welds but the cars their neighbors drove. Products went out into the world representing Japan and helping to rebuild the nation. Japanese workers believed they were doing something that mattered.\\n\\nHawthorne was the seedbed for Deming’s understanding of Profound\\n\\nKnowledge.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2: THE JUNGLE IN PARADISE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200913\\n\\nThe Makings of Modern American Management\\n\\nPrevious to Hawthorne, management styles were largely predicated on Tay- lorism and Fordism.\\n\\nBy the time Deming came to Hawthorne, both Fredrick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford had left an indelible imprint on how to manage workers. Ford’s genius wasn’t the automobile (that had already been invented) but rather the efficient assembly line. He spent countless hours creating production systems and then endlessly improving them. When he first began to make cars, it took a bevy of specialized craftsmen half a day. When he opened his new factory in 1913, it took only ninety minutes to create a Model T. The drawback for work- ers was that Ford saw them as inconvenient cogs in the machine. He sought to standardize operations to the point that a worker could be as interchangeable as any other piece of the system.\\n\\nWhere Ford’s approach was driven by practical matters, Taylor’s approach was more scientific in nature, giving rise to the term “scientific management.” In layperson’s terms, where Ford treated people like cogs in a machine, Tay- lor approached workers as if they were machines themselves—machines that could be optimized for maximum efficiency, given the right physical and psy- chological conditions.\\n\\nFordism and Taylorism were the mainstays of American management throughout the twentieth century. But at Hawthorne, Fordism and Taylorism found their first challengers. Beyond being an impressive industrial site, Haw- thorne Works became a lab of sorts. “The Works’ bustling shops provided the perfect setting for testing new manufacturing methods, and company officials gladly served up employees as subjects for groundbreaking studies.”3\\n\\nThat is, the workers became lab rats. Psychologist Elton Mayo conducted a social experiment at Hawthorne Works from 1924 to 1927 to prove the importance of people on productiv- ity—not machines.4 His social experiment measured the change in workers’ output at different levels of lighting. He found that any change in lighting increased employee productivity. However, he later discovered that the rise in output came from workers knowing they were being closely watched, not from how much light they had available. This discovery was dubbed the Hawthorne Effect, the act of subjects changing their behavior in response to being observed.\\n\\nTwo additional studies, the relay-assembly tests and the bank-wiring tests, followed Mayo’s illumination tests. Altogether, the studies assumed the label “Hawthorne experiments” and became the basis for the school of human relations.5\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200914\\n\\nDeming referred to Ford and Taylor’s influence as “living in prison under the tyranny of the prevailing style of management.”6 Today, we have shifted into the Knowledge Economy, where the most prized skills are innovation and creativity—the antithesis of Ford’s approach to management and a fundamen- tally different perspective than Taylor’s. And yet, the effects of Fordism and Taylorism can still be seen everywhere. To be blunt, this perspective is based on the idea that workers don’t want to work. That given the opportunity, they will shirk as much as possible and be as lazy as they can. There’s an assumption of underlying antagonism between “them” (the workers) and “us” (the managers). In the middle of Mayo’s Hawthorne Effect studies, Ed rolled into town. He spent months researching electrical transistors. And that time left a last- ing mark on Ed, ultimately leading to one of his four elements of Profound Knowledge, that of human psychology and motivation. His future views on management would stand in direct opposition to the methods of Ford and Tay- lor, providing an alternative to the standard way business “had always been done” in that time.\\n\\nThe Lowest Degradation of Man\\n\\nI imagine Deming chose his summer job for the same reason a college kid might intern for free in Silicon Valley: to have a front-row seat at the cutting edge of innovation, landing a role in research and development. While his Ivy League education may have prepared him to appreciate and absorb the management concepts floating around Hawthorne, it was his rural raising that prepared him for the on-the-ground reality and allowed him to empathize with the harsh conditions of the working-class people all around him. The fact that Hawthorne was the foremost industrial site in the nation didn’t change the horrendous working conditions endured by the thousands of people employed in the facto- ries. It was still a hardscrabble life, just on an industrial scale.\\n\\nBy the time Deming stepped off the trolley line in 1925, Hawthorne Works employed around forty-thousand people,* mostly women. A friend of his had forewarned him to “stay well away from the stairway when the whistle blew at the end of the day. ‘Those women will trample you to death. There won’t even be an oil slick.’”7 Later, Deming would reflect, “It was hot. It was dirty. No won- der they wanted to get out.”8\\n\\nEd held a particularly low view of a mainstay of American factories at the time: piecework, where a worker got paid according to the number of units pro- duced or tasks performed. Knowing Hawthorne operated this way, it’s likely\\n\\n\\n\\nVarious accounts peg its peak workforce at anywhere from forty-two to forty-six thousand.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2: THE JUNGLE IN PARADISE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200915\\n\\nRose was paid according to how many telephone assemblages she inspected. This type of pay scheme incentivized workers to focus on quantity, not quality. It is harder to take pride in workmanship if you knew that each person working on the unit before you got to it did a rush job. No wonder managers working under Taylorism were so suspicious and antagonistic toward the line workers. Deming would later observe, “Piecework is man’s lowest degradation.”9\\n\\n—\\n\\nAlthough Hawthorne workers took pride in the bigger picture, they still oper- ated under a system where shoddy workmanship was incentivized from the beginning. Ever the philomath, Ed was curious about everything around him. It was his good fortune to wind up at Hawthorne Works, where he could be exposed to the latest in production processes, the social experiment that was the town of Hawthorne, and the production and management experiments that were being conducted by Mayo and others. And I cannot imagine that he worked there for months without indirectly coming across the work of Dr. Wal- ter Shewhart. Unbeknownst to Ed, his relationship with the AT&T physicist researcher would become a defining factor in his life, as we’ll soon see.\\n\\nEd’s time at Hawthorne Works exposed him to new ideas about manufac- turing and labor. Workers’ autonomy outside of the factory led to a community not dictated by company patronage but one led by the community itself. The result was independent-minded individuals like Rose Cihlar. Without her experience at Hawthorne Works, I don’t know that she’d go on to work for an electrical manufacturer as a married woman with children in those early decades when women were still expected to adhere to their traditional domes- tic roles. Without her own income, her son wouldn’t have gone to Purdue nor started down the path to becoming the commander of the Apollo 17 mission. Hawthorne Works’ progressive arrangement prepared Ed to appreciate how companies and their employees could work together for the common good. When he landed in Japan decades later, he, more than any of the other Americans there, immediately grasped how crucial the special arrangement between Japanese companies and their employees was and why it led to supe- rior quality. This line of thinking would become what I believe is the striking difference between the System of Profound Knowledge and Western manage- ment: Ed discovered a human-centered approach to systems, in general, and business, in particular.\\n\\nBut before he could begin to fully articulate his System of Profound Knowledge, he had to learn from the master of variation . . . and to understand variation, we have to first appreciate the history of quality control.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200916\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nThe Birth of Quality Control & Standardization\\n\\nOur system of make-and-inspect, which if applied to making toast would be expressed: “You burn, I’ll scrape.”\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming, as quoted by Joseph Sensenbrenner\\n\\nViolins and violas, in varying stages of progress, hang from the rafters, dry- ing. On the workshop floor, apprentices toil away at their workbenches. An older man unscrews wood furlings from the cello he’s crafting. Behind him, a younger man intently files the scroll piece of a viola.\\n\\nMaster Stradivari comes into the workshop and begins to inspect their work. He strolls over to a young man carefully sanding the upper bout of a nearly finished violin. The young man lays down his sandpaper and steps back with his head down and his hands clasped. Stradivari carefully picks up the instrument to look it over.\\n\\n“Very good,” he says. “Exquisitely worked. You’ve crafted a jewel, my boy.” He takes a step as he continues. “Perfect for a courtesan or a priest to pluck after supper or polish Sundays after mass. In other words, . . .”—his tenor and coun- tenance change as his gaze moves from the instrument to the young man’s face, holding out the violin as if he were presenting it to the apprentice—“. . . this violin will never bear my name.”\\n\\nHe spins around and—WHAM!—slams the violin against the bench,\\n\\nbreaking it into splinters.\\n\\nStradivari shouts in the young man’s face, “Put your anger into your work, boy!” Then he angrily strides out of the workshop. As he does so, he shouts, “Stay with me and learn!”\\n\\nThis scene from the movie The Red Violin is, more or less, the story of tools, quality, and humankind for the last three million years. One person learned how to make a certain type of tool from “a master.” Then they made said tools one at a time by hand. A potter made one pot at a time. One blacksmith made one plow. One cooper, one barrel. One luthier, one violin.\\n\\nThe quality of anything humans made, by and large, depended on the skill of the craftsman who made it. Everything built, crafted, or made was\\n\\nunique. Craftsmen might get decently good at consistently churning out high-caliber products, but each one was still one of a kind. And by and large the quality of anything humankind made depended on the skill of the crafts- man who made it.\\n\\nThe eternal question of quality has always been this: “How good is good enough?” Carving a walking stick to hike the Appalachian Trail? Quality isn’t much of an issue. Carving the wood for a Stradivarius? Nothing less than abso- lute perfection will do.\\n\\nIf you were a soldier on the battlefield, you prayed that your new sword wasn’t made by the village blacksmith when he was blackout drunk. If there were barbarians at the gate, a feudal lord might have a moment of panic remem- bering that he’d gone with the lowest bidder to build said gates.\\n\\nHistory records a few times when we progressed from the craftsman model of production. About six hundred years before and a hundred and forty miles east of Stradivari’s workshop, the city-state of Venice created a massive assem- bly line called the Venetian Arsenal.* The shipyard there could assemble an entire seaworthy vessel from prefabricated pieces in as little as a day. (I doubt the shipwrights in Venice knew it, but they had rediscovered an idea from over a thousand years earlier and a thousand miles south, when Carthage used the ship assembly-line method during the First Punic War with the Romans.)\\n\\nAround roughly the same time, the Chinese state of Qin mass-produced some pieces of a crossbow, which played a role in conquering their neighbors and establishing the first Chinese imperial dynasty.\\n\\nBut outside of a handful of examples like these, basically everything we made for thousands of years was one at a time. Stradivari’s workshop was the story of humanity’s progress and civilizations’ development.\\n\\nBut the history of production and quality rounded a corner thanks to Thomas Jefferson passing around a pamphlet—the result of which would come to necessitate Walter Shewhart’s statistical process control and the theory of variation.\\n\\nIt was mentioned in Dante’s Inferno: As in the Arsenal of the Venetians Boils in winter the tenacious pitch To smear their unsound vessels over again For sail they cannot; and instead thereof One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks The ribs of that which many a voyage has made One hammers at the prow, one at the stern This one makes oars and that one cordage twists Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen . . .\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200918\\n\\nStandardization & the American System\\n\\nIn 1785, the United States had been a country for only nine years. Jefferson wouldn’t become president for another sixteen years. In the meantime, he was ambassador to France, where he met a gunsmith named Honoré Blanc. Blanc had unknowingly copied the Qin of China: weapons that used inter- changeable parts.\\n\\nWith Blanc’s invention, if the flintlock of your musket broke, you didn’t need to return it to a gunsmith to handcraft another one. Instead, you could pick up a new flintlock from a pile of parts and be back in the fray before you could say, “Wait, tell me again why I’m dying for some schmuck I don’t know?” Jefferson saw the importance of the invention but couldn’t convince Blanc to move from France to America, which was still being carved out of the wilds. Instead, Jefferson wrote to the first Secretary of War, General Henry Knox, explaining Blanc’s ingenious system and urging its adoption.\\n\\nIn 1798, some ten years later, the US government granted a contract to Eli Whitney to manufacture ten to fifteen thousand muskets. (This was some- what ironic, seeing as how he’d never created a musket in his life.) About ten months into Whitney’s government contract, the secretary of the treasury sent him a “foreign pamphlet on arm manufacturing techniques”—almost certainly French and, therefore, almost certainly Honoré Blanc’s. By 1801, Whitney had not only missed the contractual deadline but the quantity as well. By a magnitude of a thousand. However, with the ten guns he had, he demon- strated to Congress that the parts from any one musket could be switched out with another. If the gun broke, the Army wouldn’t have to buy a whole new gun—just a replacement part. The legislators quickly mandated that all such equipment be standardized.\\n\\nI imagine he failed to mention that it took more money to manufacture ten muskets with interchangeable parts than it did for a gunsmith to craft ten muskets. It did, however, buy him more time and earn him political support.*\\n\\nWhile Whitney didn’t invent interchangeable parts, he did a successful job of evangelizing the idea. More and more companies, and especially armories,\\n\\nIn a curious way, Whitney played an important role in an engulfing conflict decades later.\\n\\nYou might recall him as the inventor of the cotton gin, the machine that turned the American South from an agrarian society to an agricultural powerhouse, resulting in an ever-increasing reliance on slave labor. (By the mid-1800s, cotton composed over half of all the country’s exports.) At the same time, he’s largely responsible for popularizing the use of interchangeable machine parts, allowing the North to transform itself into an industrial powerhouse. That is, he’s responsible for the inventions that set the two economies on a political collision course resulting in the Civil War.\\n\\nCHAPTER 3: THE BIRTH OF QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDIZATION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200919\\n\\nbegan implementing the idea during the 1800s. On top of this, US manufactur- ers began shifting from hand labor to relying more heavily on mechanization. They went from skilled craftsmen using hand tools to semiskilled laborers operating machines.\\n\\nThese two developments led to what came to be known as the American System. While the Industrial Revolution had already begun in Britain, the American System was a profound evolution in industrial development. By 1880, the US, Europe, and elsewhere had entered what historians term the Machine Age. While these same historians might point to interchangeable parts as a key development, I think they’re missing the point. Interchange- able parts were the result, but standardization* was the catalyst.\\n\\nTo illustrate my point, consider the ubiquitous cargo ship container. It doesn’t matter whether you’re in New Orleans, New Plymouth, or Newfound- land, they look exactly the same. However, it didn’t used to be that way. As The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Econ- omy Bigger so insightfully reveals, before standardizing the size of containers, maritime trade vessels had to load cargo by hand.1 Crates of fruit, trunks of clothes, sacks of potatoes, individual automobiles, raw lumber—you shipped it however you wanted to. It was up to the longshoremen on the piers to figure out how to most efficiently load it onto ships. And each ship was different. Your goods might arrive in the hold of a cruise liner or belowdecks of a barely seaworthy trawler.\\n\\nOnce the world settled on a standard cargo container size, everything could be planned for. Ships were built to hold the exact dimensions. Cranes could be computerized because they needed to work with only one type of con- tainer. Rates could be standardized because transporters knew the dimensions of their loads; cost became a simple matter of weight, distance, and priority. Trucks and trains could be configured to all carry the same size box, meaning you could load a container of your products onto a railcar, see it lifted onto the bed of a tractor-trailer, set on a ship, unloaded, and transported to your cus- tomer . . . without ever opening its doors. Maritime trade went from relying on specialized skill sets to standardized processes—making everything far, far cheaper to transport and trade.\\n\\nWhen I worked at the IT company Docker, The Box and its underlying principles were the founder’s bible. By standardizing the way we created data servers, we could format thousands of servers in the same amount of time it would take to conventionally format one.\\n\\nMost modern IT thinkers would instead refer to this as uniformity, but for ease of explanation,\\n\\nwe’re going to stick with standardization.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200920\\n\\nStandardization: That’s what changed the world. That’s what spurred the Machine Age and everything that came after. Factories standardized their products and processes. Manufacturing quality had evolved from one crafts- man’s skill to an era of standardization.\\n\\nStandardization improved production, but despite all the technological innovations and progress, production still hinged on the same problem Strad- ivari had: sometimes the product didn’t come out right. You’d have to scrap the whole thing and start over. Interchangeable parts were, in fact, the turn- ing point in the history of quality control and led to the theory of variation. But even with interchangeable parts, producers soon discovered that exact specifications were unrealistic. No matter how precise the machines and the processes, the outputs all slightly varied from each other.\\n\\nThis spawned a need to allow for variance in product specifications. Think of the notion of an exact fit as a deterministic approach (as we learned about in Chapter 1). Specifications that allow for a certain variance—or tolerance—are more in line with a non-deterministic approach.\\n\\nThe people in charge of a manufacturing process had to decide the limits of what was acceptable. How much variation would they allow or tolerate in the finished products? They called these “tolerance limits.” Industrial producers switched from trying to achieve an exact fit to allowing products to be man- ufactured within certain tolerance limits. In the beginning, these limits were simply named “go/no-go.”\\n\\nGo or No-Go?\\n\\nBack at Hawthorne Works, this was essentially Rose Cihlar’s job. She was a qual- ity inspector. It was her job to act like Stradivari. As telephone systems rolled off the assembly line, Rose carefully inspected each one. Unlike Stradivari, she had some tools to test the specification tolerance. If the telephone fell within those tolerance limits, it was a “go.” Otherwise, she marked it as a defect—a “no- go”—and tossed it in the reject bin. Out of the forty thousand or so workers at Hawthorne, five thousand of them were inspectors like Rose, inspecting and rejecting all day long. Over one hundred thousand individual parts and pieces composing the individual telephone were scrapped just like that. While the fac- tory manufactured telephones, its second-biggest output was scrap.\\n\\nWith Stradivarius violins, each one was the work of a master craftsman. Master Stradivari allowed no defects for instruments coming out of his work- shop. However, the idea of zero defects is realistically impossible. No two violins are exactly the same. Each one has some flaw, no matter how tiny and insignificant.\\n\\nCHAPTER 3: THE BIRTH OF QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDIZATION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200921\\n\\nNow, imagine a huge factory making one hundred thousand different components to be assembled into one telephone. Imagine mass manufacturing thousands of telephones. That means millions of factory systems and pro- cesses. The idea of creating every single component with absolute perfection is ludicrous. Stuff happens. Every single finished product slightly differs from all the others. As Deming noted in his final years, variation is a part of life.\\n\\nImagine the cannons on a pirate ship. When iron foundries first made can- nons, they would create a vertical clay mold. To make the shape of the cannon’s cylinder, they would create the mold of a long shaft. Next, they stood a long piece of clay in the middle of the shaft. (Otherwise, the result would be a thick iron rod.) They’d pour the iron into the mold and let it cool. Then, they’d break all the clay out of the middle of the shaft. The result was a cylinder.\\n\\nAs you might imagine, this was not a precise process. Sometimes, work- ers would make the clay column a little too thick, resulting in thinner cannon walls. Too thin and the cannon could explode like a bomb, killing the pirates and maybe sinking the ship. Sometimes workers would make the clay column too thin, resulting in thicker cannon walls. Too thick and it wouldn’t hold any cannonballs. It was just an expensive piece of useless metal. The foundry man- ager had to decide how thick was too thick and how thin was too thin. These tolerance limits dictated if the cannon was a go or a no-go. Despite these limits, there was still considerable variation between cannons.\\n\\nFor the sake of explanation, let’s say the “perfect” size for the mouth of the cannon was 84 mm across. But because nothing was ever perfect, the foundry owner would allow anything between 83 mm to 85 mm to pass. Anything inside that range was a go; anything outside was a no-go and sent to the scrap heap. A Swiss engineer in the 1700s named Jean Maritz came up with a better way to manufacture cannons. He did away with the interior clay column alto- gether and forged what was essentially a huge, thick iron rod, then used a drill to bore out the inside. His method resulted in much more precise cannon sizes. Continuing our example, let’s say his way resulted in less variation. The cannons’ mouths might vary between 83.5 mm and 84.5 mm. Less variation meant a “tighter” tolerance limit. The higher the cannon’s quality, the more effective its range and accuracy. The tighter a cannonball fit in a cannon’s mouth, the less air could get around the cannonball. The less air, the more explosive the force of the gunpowder on the cannonball, allowing the cannon to shoot farther.\\n\\nGrowing up poor as he did, I imagine frugality was almost in Ed’s DNA. The sheer amount of waste generated at Hawthorne Works must have boggled his mind. Surely, there was a way to improve this.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200922\\n\\nFrom his background in non-determinism, Ed understood that randomness and variation are simply facts of life . . . even in standardized manufacturing processes. He must have mulled for hours on how to find the solution to pro- cess deviations and defects inherent to the operations of Hawthorne.\\n\\nAs he came to find out, the answer lies with mathematics and statistics. Little did Deming know that he was about to get a front-row seat to the next turning point in the history of quality in the form of Dr. Walter Shewhart.\\n\\nCHAPTER 3: THE BIRTH OF QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDIZATION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200923\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\nThe Root of All Evil\\n\\nA half century has passed since Dr. Shewhart’s great book of 1931 appeared, and almost a half century since his book of 1939 appeared.

Sparta besieged the city-state of Plataea. Finding themselves at an impasse, the Spartans built what amounted to a containment wall around the city. They stationed a few guards, and the rest went home. At some point, desperation, starvation, or deprivation would open the city gates; the Spartans simply needed to wait them out.\\n\\nIf necessity is the mother of invention, desperation is its muse. A sooth- sayer and a general hatched a bold plan: build ladders to scale the walls under the cover of night and escape between the enemy’s encampments. After mak- ing the decision, the only real question was: how tall did the ladders need to be? Since the Plataeans couldn’t exactly climb to the top of the walls and use a tape measure in one hand while fending off Spartans with the other,* they devised another means. They counted the bricks from afar.\\n\\nAccording to Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War, one side of the\\n\\nSpartans’ wall was\\n\\n. . . facing the town, at a place where the wall had accidentally not been plastered. A great many counted at once, and, although some might\\n\\nRemember who we’re talking about: “This. Is. SPARTA!”\\n\\nmake mistakes, the calculation would be oftener right than wrong; for they repeated the process again and again. . . . In this manner they ascer- tained the proper length of the ladders . . .1\\n\\nIt was a narrow escape, but they pulled it off. Saved by standardization. The bricks were all made of a common—a.k.a. standard-ish—size. All they needed to do was count how many brick layers there were and multiply that by the height of an everyday brick.\\n\\nHumans being human, though, not everyone agreed on how many layers of bricks there were. So, they had a lot of people count. Out of ten people, let’s say that six counted forty layers and two of them counted forty-one. Guy num- ber nine was dead sure there were only thirty-nine layers. And the tenth guy reported fifty-nine, though he sort of slurred his words as he did.\\n\\nWhat number should the ladder makers use? Thirty-nine? Forty? Forty-one?\\n\\nFifty-nine? All of them couldn’t be right, of course; three must be in error.\\n\\nThe Plataeans could have sent out even more people to count the layers, but at some point, the Spartans would start getting suspicious. They’d have to use the numbers they had. If they built the ladders too long, it’d mean more men to carry each one, making it harder to be stealthy. If they built them too short, well, what was the point? There was no certainty. It came down to a question of confidence: how sure were the would-be escapees in each of the four numbers?\\n\\nThey had zero confidence in the guy who counted fifty-nine bricks high. Nobody else counted anything near his number, and it sounded like he’d found the last bottle of wine in town, anyway. Thirty-nine was in the ballpark, but only one person got that number. In the realm of “how good is good enough,” they’d much rather err on the side of caution. The two people saying it was for- ty-one were known to have excellent eyesight, and most of the others counted forty layers, anyway. Everyone could feel fairly confident that the wall was somewhere around forty to forty-one bricks high. Whichever number they set- tled on, their estimates were good enough to get them over the wall.\\n\\nIn the end, out of the two hundred and twenty who made the attempt, two hundred and twelve escaped. This is statistics, variance, and probability in a nutshell (obviously, it’s more complicated than that). It’s not about certainty; that’s determinism. One of the linchpins of Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge is understanding uncertainty; that is, applying statistics to varia- tion (which in this case would be the differences between how many bricks each person counted). This allows us to quantify certainty versus uncertainty.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200926\\n\\nPut another way, statistics is about how confident you feel when dealing with uncertainty. It’s about how probable an outcome is. If you let go of an apple, there is an extremely high probability it will hit the floor. If you pick any American, there’s a 50% chance they earn below the median income. If you pick a spot on the globe at random, there’s a 71% chance you’ll hit water. It’s all about chance and probabilities.\\n\\nDeming gives us a great, simple example of variability. If you ask three peo- ple to count the number of people in the room, you might get three different answers. The answers depend on each counter’s definition of “the room.” Should the count include the people serving food or be limited to the guests? Should it include the open patio attached to the room?\\n\\nNobel Prize–winning physicist Percy Williams Bridgman was also con- cerned with variation when creating synthetic diamonds using extreme pressures. His gauges kept breaking down when they worked under extreme pressure, so he had no idea what pressure levels he had reached. This work led him to describe a general philosophical doctrine called operationalism. It is based on the idea that we can know the meaning of something only if we have a way of measuring it.\\n\\nIn 1927, Bridgman published The Logic of Modern Physics, examining how scientists define measurements. This work later inspired Shewhart’s and Dem- ing’s ideas around what Bridgman coined an operational definition. Deming defined an operational definition in his book The New Economics as a procedure agreed upon to translate a concept into a precise measurement.2 Operational definition became a key component of Deming’s theories of knowledge and variation.\\n\\nWhile Ed was interning at Hawthorne Works, a man at the research arm of Western Electric was grappling with how to minimize manufacturing defects. Dr. Walter Shewhart believed there had to be a more economical way than sim- ply standardizing production and using go/no-go tolerance limits. He wanted to minimize the variation between each telephone made. Being a physicist, his instinct was to try to solve the problem mathematically.\\n\\nWhereas basic statistics uses overall averages, he used a form of statis- tics that specifically averages the variation of defects—known as standard deviation. While standard deviation had been historically used in some areas of science, particularly with non-determinism, he was the first to apply non- deterministic methods to manufacturing.\\n\\nCuriously enough, standard deviation came about, in part, from counting\\n\\nstars.\\n\\nCHAPTER 4: THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200927\\n\\nThe Celestial Police\\n\\nAt its core, astronomy has always been about measuring. When do certain plan- etary bodies appear and disappear? What’s the distance from the horizon to this constellation, and how does that change over the four seasons? How long is daylight throughout the year? For that matter, what’s a year? Thousands of observations by amateurs and professionals alike, all from different parts of the world, all writing down everything by hand—can you imagine?\\n\\nAstronomy began making great strides during the Scientific Revolution. In 1543, Copernicus published his observations supporting his theory that the solar system revolves around the sun (not the Earth).\\n\\nIn the early 1600s, Johannes Kepler wrote the laws of planetary motion. Based on his observations, Kepler noticed a pattern in planets’ sizes and move- ments across the sky. He spent years coming up with a mathematical formula that could explain why planets behaved the way they did. He wanted a perfect formula but would settle for whatever best fit the measurements he had. He had assumed that early astronomers had dismissed the idea of elliptical orbits; for years, he’d imagined that planets traveled in a perfect circle around the sun. No matter how hard he squeezed, the data told him he was wrong. He tried an egg-shaped orbit, which didn’t work. Since circles and eggs weren’t the answer, he finally tried an ellipse.\\n\\nIt fit. Not perfectly, mind you . . . but good enough. Armed with this knowledge, he flipped things on their head. He had reverse-engineered the formula from the observations. Now that he had the formula, he used it to predict where other planets in the solar system would be—from observed measurements to a formula that best fit the data. From a best-fit formula to predicting data—statistics at its finest.\\n\\nArmed with this information, Kepler believed there should be a planet between Mars and Jupiter. He was wrong . . . but he was kind of right too. One hundred and forty years after Kepler’s death, another astronomer used the additional century’s worth of data and developments to create his own predictive formula, dubbed the Titius-Bode law. It, too, predicted a planet between Mars and Jupiter, as well as predicting the distance of a planet beyond Saturn.\\n\\nLo and behold, in 1781 astronomers found a planet beyond Saturn: Uranus. The Titius-Bode law gained credibility. Soon, astronomers were search- ing for the “lost” planet between Mars and Jupiter. After conversing with the discoverer of Uranus, a Hungarian astronomer assembled a crack team of twenty-four fellow astronomers. Their purpose: to coordinate their efforts to systematically search for it. He dubbed them the Celestial Police.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200928\\n\\nOne of these astronomers was an Italian priest in Palermo named Giuseppe Piazzi. As fate would have it, he had already discovered the lost planet before his invitation to join the Celestial Police arrived in the mail. As irony would have it, he discovered it by accident.\\n\\nThat New Year’s Day in 1801, Piazzi didn’t know what he was looking at. It looked like a comet, but it acted like a planet. He made his observations for a little over a month before he became ill. By the time he’d sent notes to other astronomers who could observe the unidentified orbiting object, it had been obscured by the sun. By the end of the year, Piazzi knew it would have almost completed its orbit and should be visible again . . . but he couldn’t find it. He’d only been able to make twenty-four observations—not enough to predict where it would reappear.\\n\\nA twenty-four-year-old German child prodigy decided to tackle the prob- lem of how to use scant data to create a formula to predict where this thing should be. In three months, Carl Friedrich Gauss developed “Gauss’s method.” (With just a bit of tweaking, Gauss’s method would later become the basis for global positioning systems, or GPS.) Using Gauss’s method, the Hungarian chief of the Celestial Police spotted the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in our solar system’s main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, just a few days shy of the one-year anniversary of Piazzi’s first observation.\\n\\nSix years later, Gauss abandoned pure mathematics (he didn’t think it was worth it, apparently) and became an astronomer himself. While pursuing astronomical calculations (literally), Gauss laid the foundation for the statistics we’re talking about here.\\n\\nThis was Gauss\\'s way of quantifying the randomness of his and other astronomers’ observations. With the Plataeans’ ladders, being a foot off was good enough. When dealing with pinpricks in the night sky that constantly change position, he needed to be a lot more precise. Gauss needed to remove as many measurement errors as possible. His method was essentially a way to quantify what the Plataeans did instinctively. He called these variations the mean error; the statistician Karl Pearson would come to refer to this as stan- dard deviation—a core principle Shewhart used to create Statistical Process Control.\\n\\nGetting Quality Under Statistical Process Control\\n\\nIt’s eerie how much of Walter Shewhart’s life echoes Deming’s (or maybe the other way around). He was born nine years before Deming on a rural farm in western Illinois. In 1910, he enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. He earned his doctorate in physics there in 1917.\\n\\nCHAPTER 4: THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200929\\n\\nHe taught physics in Wisconsin, but that changed when Congress voted to enter World War I after the sinking of the Lusitania. The US Army, Navy, and budding Air Force placed $22 million worth of orders—about $500 million today—for communications equipment with Western Electric. Spurred by a sense of patriotism, Shewhart left academia to join the company’s engineering department. He moved his family to Brooklyn and commuted to his office at Western Electric’s building at 463 West Street overlooking the Hudson.*\\n\\nOf course, the vast majority of Western Electric’s manufacturing took place at Hawthorne Works. Sometime between the end of the World War I and 1922, Shewhart became interested (some might say obsessed) with improv- ing production quality. He was convinced that he could take the mathematical statistics concepts he’d learned as a physicist and apply them to production processes. On a Friday in May 1924, he summarized some of his ideas in a one- page memo to his boss, George Edwards.\\n\\nAs Isaac Asimov is attributed as saying, “The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ (I found it!) but ‘That’s funny . . . ’” That’s how I feel about Shewhart’s memo. It should have been a eureka moment. Instead, there was no fanfare. No ticker tape parade. Nobody knew the history of manufacturing had made one of its most import- ant turning points.\\n\\nShewhart created a statistical system to improve production quality. He took the idea of tolerance limits and flipped it on its head with statistics. Instead of looking at telephones as good enough or not—that black-and- white deterministic thinking the world was used to—Shewhart quantified the variation.\\n\\nHe could now tell the managers at Hawthorne what percentage of prod- ucts fell statistically within their tolerance limits. Far more importantly, it gave managers a method to track variation. If you can track variation, then you can trace variation to better understand why a production line creates defects and detects them much earlier in the process.\\n\\nIn essence, Shewhart created a way to continually improve any manufac- turing line. This was the first time factory managers had been given a tool to let them manage the uncertainty in production.\\n\\nHis method, Statistical Process Control, let managers compare variation across workers and machines. The more managers could find and fix the causes behind factory defects, the more products they could produce that fell within their tolerance limits, thus improving their overall quality. And higher quality\\n\\nThe building is still there, having been declared a National Historic Landmark.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200930\\n\\nmeant less waste; less waste allowed manufacturers to do more and more with less and less.*\\n\\nThink of an automaker doing a recall because of a braking issue. Tens of thousands of cars all have to be brought into their local dealerships to get their brakes fixed, costing the car company a fortune. In general, it’s cheaper to pro- duce higher-quality brakes in the first place than to fix a mistake after the fact. Shewhart’s genius was taking statistics from academia—physics, astron- omy, biology, etc.—and applying it to Hawthorne’s assembly lines. He wanted to cut down on how much Western Electric wasted. For the first time in history, we had finally stepped beyond a simple go/no-go approach to making things. Tracking cold, hard numbers allowed managers to track patterns in the data. Shewhart’s method was a paradigm shift. It was the first example of anti-Taylorism, where using math and statistics enabled management to see defects as results of the process instead of the workers. Before this, most man- agers viewed their employees like Stradivari did his apprentices. If the product was bad, it must be the workers’ fault. Stradivari never stopped to consider whether the woodcutter had sold him wood from a diseased tree. Never stopped to see if the apprentices’ tools were sufficient. Never once considered that he himself might be a poor teacher. His reaction was to blame the worker.\\n\\nBy 1929, Shewhart had formalized this new method of tracking and tracing variation. Basically, he applied the scientific method to manufacturing. Before this, manufacturing was a linear process. You figured out what you wanted and how many. You made them. Then you inspected and threw away the defects.\\n\\nShewhart turned this into a cycle, what Ed would later call the Shewhart Cycle: Figure out what you want, make it, inspect it, figure out what caused the defects, go fix it, and then go through the whole cycle again, using feedback from your mistakes to continuously improve production quality.\\n\\nEven after Deming tweaked the Shewhart cycle, he still referred to it throughout his life as the Shewhart wheel. Despite this, his students in Japan called it the Deming cycle. Today, you might recognize it as the “plan, do, check, act” method, or simply the PDCA cycle.\\n\\nIn his later years, however, Deming came to rename check as study. To his way of thinking, check was too much like the go/no-go inspection process of checking manufactured products. He believed the better term was study, which implied approaching the results with a scientific curiosity to investigate and understand why things turned out the way they did.\\n\\nYes, my fellow software developers: a hundred years ago, a telephone engineer invented “shift\\n\\nleft,” allowing us to be more proactive instead of reactive.\\n\\nCHAPTER 4: THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200931\\n\\nWhy Does It Vary?\\n\\nShewhart classified defects as being caused by one of two things. The first was chance, what Deming would later call common cause. These were variations that could be predicted and should be planned for. The second was assignable, or what Deming would call special cause,* causes that couldn’t be predicted and shouldn’t be planned for.\\n\\nVariation always occurs in all processes. For Shewhart, as long as the vari- ance fell within standard-deviation limits, the variance was inherent to the manufacturing process (i.e., assignable or common-cause variation).\\n\\nSometimes the variation’s cause was an outlier, like an employee not being trained well or a machine that broke. That’s not something Hawthorne’s man- agers would have predicted. These special cases or anomalies are not part of normal or standard operations; hence, chance or special-cause variation.\\n\\nThe real value of Statistical Process Control is that it allows you to observe variation and look at random versus non-random patterns. A random pattern represents a stable process, a.k.a. a process “under control.” A non-random pattern is a useful predictor of potential defects, signaling an amount of uncer- tainty in the process. And here is the root of all evil: misidentifying variation. Let me illustrate. Say I have an iPhone app for my thermostat. I like to keep my home at 70°F for the dogs when I’m away for the day. I expect the temperature to vary from 68°F to 75°F throughout the day. This is normal or common-cause variation; it’s to be expected. I don’t need to worry or intervene. However, 80°F would be problematic for my pets. If I noticed the tempera- ture on my iPhone app trending upward from 68°F to 72°F to 74°F—that is, a non-random pattern—I might suspect that something was off. Maybe my A/C is on the fritz. This might signal a problem leading to a special cause, meaning I might need to intervene before the temperature becomes harmful to my pets. Shewhart understood that all processes have variation, but patterns of variation in a process can reveal insights into future defects. That’s why Sta- tistical Process Control is so phenomenal: It allows you to statistically predict defects before they occur.†\\n\\nWhy would his student rename these types of variation? Deming was the quintessential\\n\\nacademic, a lifelong student and teacher who took great care choosing his words. Rather than focusing on the source of variation, he used the words common and special to emphasize the system. The analysis could focus on the people who were responsible for changing the system rather than examining each cause separately.\\n\\n† To understand patterns of variation—there are at least eight—and predicting defects, go delve\\n\\ninto operations research.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200932\\n\\nIn The New Economics, Deming explained variation with the example of an insurance actuary who was constantly late. After reading his true-to-life example, I realized I’d had the exact same experience. At one of my startups, I had a software developer—let’s call him Bob—who was one of the best I’d ever worked with. Gifted, he took to code like a fish to water. He did have one annoy- ing habit: he was chronically ten to fifteen minutes late every morning, getting to our thirty-minute morning team meeting halfway through. Then he’d always say, “You won’t believe what happened to me this morning!” and spend another five minutes regaling us with a story. One time he was late because a goth guy got his foot stuck in the subway door. Another time, there was a protest outside of a furrier. A neighborhood parade. A fight outside a bagel shop.\\n\\nYou see, Bob didn’t grow up in New York City. He didn’t know that these kinds of weird things happen all the time. While each occurrence was unique, overall, these were common occurrences. They always made him ten to fifteen minutes late. Even if he couldn’t predict what would happen, he could always count on something happening. As such, he should have planned the process of his morning commute to take fifteen minutes longer than expected. Every. Single. Day.\\n\\nAnd every single day, the team would lose fifteen to twenty minutes of our thirty-minute meeting between waiting on Bob to show up and hearing the lat- est edition of “You won’t believe this . . . .” Firing Bob was out of the question; he was simply too valuable. And he was a hard worker; he spent hours of his own time at home working on problems and coding issues. There was no way I was going to chew him out for being a few minutes late every morning.\\n\\nIf I’d been smarter, I would have realized I was dealing with a common- cause problem: I could always count on Bob being ten to fifteen minutes late . . . so, why didn’t I just start our morning meeting at 8:15? Neither Bob nor I understood that his being late was common-cause variation—something normal in day-to-day commuting in the Big Apple, regardless of Bob’s exotic story du jour.\\n\\nHere’s another example of misidentifying variation. The manager of a datacenter misidentified a special case as something common to the system. The datacenter was built out in the backwoods of an area that rarely experi- enced snow. Well, one day, there was a freak snowstorm. It was so bad that no cars could get on the road. None of the center’s call and operations staff could get to work that day. The datacenter’s functions were limited, and the company lost a lot of money.\\n\\nThe odds of this happening again were quite slim. However, the datacenter manager decided that he would never let this happen again and mandated that\\n\\nCHAPTER 4: THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200933\\n\\nall new hires who were part of the call and operations staff had to live within a mile of the datacenter. He misidentified special-cause variation as something that should be predictable (i.e., common-cause variation).\\n\\nFiring Bob would have been applying special-cause logic to a common- cause situation. However, the datacenter manager requiring all new hires to live within a mile of the place was applying common-cause logic to a special- cause situation.\\n\\nAccording to Shewhart’s Statistical Process Control, managers shouldn’t waste their time trying to fix every single problem. Instead, they should iden- tify which ones can be predicted and fix them. Identify the ones that will likely never happen again and don’t make knee-jerk decisions. As a result, managers can spend their time on things they can control and waste very little of their time on things they can’t.\\n\\nWhen Ed was introduced to Shewhart years later, after he had left Haw- thorne, the lightbulb went off. Ed already knew variation was a fact of life; as a mathematical physicist, he was intimately familiar with thinking in sta- tistics and probabilities. Shewhart’s insights quantified this variability in manufacturing.\\n\\nSince the randomness could be predicted, Ed understood that defects weren’t due to the workers but to how the manufacturing process was designed and operated. As we’ll see, this understanding—that workers weren’t the prob- lem in any given system—would go on to become one of Ed’s most important ideas (the Theory of Variation) in Profound Knowledge. But that wouldn’t be for many years to come.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200934\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\nPragmatist\\n\\nKnowing begins and ends in experience; but it does not end in the experi- ence in which it begins.\\n\\n—C. I. Lewis, “Experience and Meaning”\\n\\nShewhart imparted one more foundational concept to Ed: the philosophy of pragmatism, what Deming would later call the Theory of Knowledge, the first element in the System of Profound Knowledge. And this uniquely American philosophy began with an unliked and unlikely character who just wanted to measure things. This character was fascinated with a problem that had plagued humanity almost ever since Lucy began making tools. That is, the fundamen- tal challenge of accuracy and standardization in measurement as well as the dichotomy of the pursuit of perfection over the practical.\\n\\nHow Do You Know What You Know?\\n\\nLe Grand K. Sounds like the stage name of a French rap artist. It is a stage name of sorts, not for a person but a piece of platinum-iridium sitting in three vacuum-sealed bell jars in an environmentally controlled, underground, tri- ple-locked vault outside of Paris since 1879. France’s version of Fort Knox, if you will. It’s so precious that it’s been “out” only three times: 1899, 1939, and 1988.\\n\\nThis antique oddity is dense, twice as dense as lead. The golf ball–sized cyl- inder is incredibly strong and will never rust. Despite its hardiness, it’s handled with kid gloves. Well, better, actually: its guardians are too afraid to touch it even using gloves. They use a special tool wrapped in filter paper to avoid even the most minute of scratches. Perish the thought of a fingerprint!\\n\\nSuch care is usually only given to highly valuable works of art, like a Fabergé egg. Not even the British crown jewels get this kind of treatment. Curiously, this unremarkable piece of metal is worth only about $43,000. What gives? Why does this smooth little alloy cylinder warrant so much security and care? What’s its significance? Perhaps at risk of sounding melodramatic, this piece of metal is how we measure the world. Or most of it, anyway.\\n\\nStarting in 1879, this small metallic chunk has served as the international prototype of the kilogram. It doesn’t weigh a kilogram; rather, a kilogram is whatever it weighs. There are six official copies; those, plus the original, are stored at the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint-Cloud, France. Forty replicas were created in 1884 and distributed to a handful of nations. The US, for example, received two (named K4 and K20). All the official measurements for anything measured in kilograms in each country are calibrated to these copies of Le Grand K. Pharmaceutical scales, aerospace calibrators, surgical equipment, you name it: they are all derived from the same international standard. Every forty or so years, the copies are flown to Saint-Cloud to be compared to Le Grand K and recertified as being exactly one kilogram.\\n\\nThe problem is that a kilogram isn’t always a kilogram. Like my own diets, K20 initially “lost” weight in the recertification of 1948 but by its next weigh-in had gained it all back. (Unlike my diets, the differences were measured in micro- grams.) K4, like those I envy, consistently lost weight with every check-in. Some of this ebb and flow had to do with differences in how the weights were cleaned and stored, and even how they absorbed atoms floating in the air.\\n\\nAll jokes aside, this was a serious problem. If I’m flying in a thirty-year-old airplane, I want to know that the calipers the engineers used to design the plane are the exact same size as the ones the maintenance people used to service the plane this morning. We can’t have wandering measurements, and many of our global measurements are derived from the kilogram (such as the newton and ampere*) as well as derivatives of those measures (such as the pascal and joule†) and those measures’ measures (such as the watt, volt, tesla, and lumen‡).\\n\\nImagine how much worse it was before scientists began to standardize measurements. A “foot” was the length of a human foot. Can you imagine King James—LeBron, that is—asking a cobbler for a pair of shoes one foot long? Everyone used different measures. In the ninth century, Charlemagne decided his foot would be the standard foot everyone in his empire should use. In the twelfth century, King Henry I declared a foot to be one-third the length of his own arm. His arm was thirty-six inches; thus, the twelve-inch foot used only by the US, Myanmar, and Liberia still adhering to the imperial system. In the thirteenth century, King Edward II decided that three grains of barley, or a “barleycorn,” would be used for shoe size measurement, with thirty-six barley- corns equaling one foot.\\n\\nMeasures of force and electrical current, respectively. † Measures of pressure and energy, respectively. ‡ Measures of power, electrical potential, magnetism, and brightness, respectively.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200936\\n\\nSo many local and regional measures were used that at one point there were something like a quarter-million different measures of length, weight, etc. A pound of lead in one part of the world could be lighter than a pound of lead in another.\\n\\nThe Metre Convention on May 20, 1875, established the metric system, including the kilogram (cue the first Le Grand K) and the meter. The think- ers behind it wanted a system of measurements “for all times; for all people.” The Treaty of the Meter defined a meter as one-half of one-ten millionth the distance between the North Pole and the equator. Seeing as how that was a somewhat inconvenient thing to measure, the more practically minded think- ers agreed on a handy substitute: a meter would be defined as the cord length needed for a clock’s pendulum to travel one swing per second. This was about as close to a universal constant as they could agree on.\\n\\nBut no matter how hard you try to get the perfect measurement, there’s always going to be some troublemaker who comes along and picks holes in it. In this case, Charles Sanders Pierce.\\n\\nC. S. Pierce was a bona fide member of the Boston Brahmins, the elite of society. It was said that before immigrating to America, the Brahmins sent their servants ahead on the Mayflower to prepare the summer cottage—a blue blood in every sense of the term.\\n\\nHe was, however, brilliant. He was particularly fascinated by weather (he would be employed off and on with the US Weather Service) and precision measurements—pendulums, in particular. He recognized early on that pendulums of different lengths swung a two-second cycle depending on local variations in the Earth’s gravity. He became obsessed with improving pendulums’ precision. But if pendul- umns everywhere in the world needed to be of slightly different lengths for a uniform cycle, then a meter in Britain wouldn’t equal a meter in Boston. Not precisely.\\n\\nIn 1872, Pierce, along with the famous Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and others, founded the Metaphysical Club to discuss philoso- phy. These budding philosophers rejected the deterministic worldview of their European counterparts who espoused Enlightenment. Pierce called their new idea pragmatism.\\n\\nA proponent of Pierce’s, a man by the name of C. I. Lewis (not to be con- fused with C. S. Lewis of Narnian fame), authored a book called Mind and the World-Order.1 The ideas it contained were fundamental to Shewhart’s creation of statistical process control.\\n\\nIn the book, Lewis explains the difference between two types of knowledge: a priori, meaning before the fact, and a posteriori, meaning after the fact. This\\n\\nCHAPTER 5: PRAGMATIST\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200937\\n\\nwas rooted in the thinking of Aristotle. In the Enlightenment’s way of think- ing, you could know something without needing evidence to prove it. Descartes wrote, “I think; therefore, I am.” He knew something without needing any kind of outside validation or evidence—a priori knowledge. Another example would be knowing that one plus one equals two. Philosophers don’t need to run an experiment to know the answer is two; they just do.\\n\\nA posteriori knowledge is when you know something because, and only because, you have the evidence to prove it. A priori thinking would say, “Add a gallon of milk to a gallon of milk and you’ll have two gallons of milk.” Pierce’s new branch of philosophy would say, “I know I have two gallons of milk because I added one gallon of milk to a gallon I already had.” One theorizes; the other experiments and observes.\\n\\nA priori thinkers believed they could reason their way out of anything inside their own heads; a posteriori thinkers, or “pragmatists,” believed they could reason their way through something only by doing it. Put another way: They believed experience was the best teacher.\\n\\nWith his pendulums, for example, Pierce realized it was possible to cre- ate a perfectly precise pendulum. Theoretically. Practically speaking, there was a point where creating an ever-better pendulum simply wasn’t worth it. Mathematically, he had reached a point of diminishing returns: investing more time and money simply didn’t make any sense. Philosophically, he reasoned that using a pendulum’s swing as the basic unit of measurement simply wasn’t practical.\\n\\nThat’s why in 1877, just two years after the world’s top minds agreed on using grandfather clocks as the basis for all physical measurements of distance in the universe, Pierce wrote that the meter should be tied to an unalterable, absolute unit of measurement: a certain number of wavelengths of light at a certain frequency.\\n\\nHis ideas were taken up and improved upon by Albert Michelson, who would win the 1907 Nobel Prize in Physics for measuring the prototype of a meter to within one-tenth of a wavelength. In 2019, one hundred and forty- four years to the day, the successors of the Treaty of the Meter redefined the meter in terms of the speed of light. They also redefined the kilogram from being measured by an expensive paperweight to being a derivative of Planck’s universal constant.\\n\\nThe story of accuracy and standardization is, in reality, a story of prag- matism. At any given time, a standard is a measurement that suffices and that everybody agrees upon. Even Planck’s universal constant is a pragmatic approximation of the true value. The idea of a pragmatic approach to standards\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200938\\n\\ncoupled with the accuracy of measurement (described in Chapters 3 and 4) is a great example of why Profound Knowledge is so revelatory. If we focused only on the Theory of Variation without applying the Theory of Knowledge, we’d miss the opportunity to improve upon standards (Pierce, for example, finding a better way to measure the meter).\\n\\nAmerica’s Jazz Philosophy\\n\\nJazz may be America’s one truly original musical art form. Pragmatism is Amer- ica’s one truly original contribution to philosophy.*\\n\\nConsider the number pi. We learn about the basic concept in high-school algebra. It’s simply a circle’s circumference divided by its radius. When we do the math, however, we quickly discover that the division problem just keeps going and going. Our teachers tell us to round it to two decimal places and simply use 3.14.\\n\\nA pragmatist says, “Okay, 3.14 is good enough for what we’re doing here—it doesn’t make sense to find its absolute value. We’ve got too many other things to do.” While the determinist would spend his life calculating all the digits in pi, the pragmatist would say, “I can’t spend my life doing a math problem—I’ve got real problems to solve. Two decimal places is close enough.”\\n\\nWhile this simple example sounds like common sense, most people are still stuck in the absolute deterministic approach. They believe that perfection can—and should!—be reached.\\n\\nPragmatists begin with observations and empirical data—in other words, hard evidence—then work their way backward. This might sound simple, but it’s actually quite rare for people to think like this. Most rely on “common knowledge,” knee-jerk reactions, and going along with “the way we’ve always done it around here.”\\n\\nIn Taylor’s and Ford’s time, quality inspection was essentially a ques- tion of whether a product was close enough to perfect to pass. But Shewhart, bringing a pragmatic outlook, asked, why wasn’t it perfect? In so many words, he said, “Look, perfection is an illusion. We’ll never reach it. But if we use a posteriori thinking, we can systematically improve how we manage what we manufacture.”†\\n\\nThanks to Jabe Bloom for this brilliant observation. † Pragmatism was the basis for the Shewhart cycle of continuous improvement, what would\\n\\ncome to be known as Deming’s PDSA (plan, do, study, act).\\n\\nCHAPTER 5: PRAGMATIST\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200939\\n\\nLet me provide a modern example of the perfection mentality. There was a time when the owners and managers of banks, insurance companies, and major retailers wanted their websites to have 100% uptime; they didn’t want their websites to be down. Ever. That may have been the goal, but the reality was too chaotic to adhere to corporate policy. Well, if the suits couldn’t have 100%, how about 99%? Or 99.9%? Could the IT guys get it up to 99.99%? Of course, five nines would be even better! Just how many extra nines could the IT depart- ment get to? This went on for years (and still goes on today).\\n\\nThen Google published a book called Site Reliability Engineering. It shed light on how Google had grown by gathering data from an exponential explo- sion in the number of websites in the world. Back when Yahoo! launched, there were about three thousand sites. Right now, that number is in the ten figures. How did Google manage its systems to collect all that data? They real- ized that absolute reliability was impossible and abandoned the goal of 100% uptime. Instead, they asked themselves two simple questions:\\n\\n1. How much more money would we make with an extra 9? 2. Does adding that extra 9 cost more than we would make?\\n\\nBecause Google makes its money primarily from advertising, it could cal- culate how much money it lost during a web outage down to a fraction of a cent. As such, they could calculate the company’s pragmatic limit.\\n\\nFor the sake of simplicity, let’s say Google makes $10 million a month from selling ads. That’s roughly $240 a minute. For this example, let’s further say they have 99.9% reliability, meaning their website is down for only 43 minutes a month. That means they lose $10,320 a month.\\n\\nA new manager takes over and says that’s not good enough. He needs to brag to his golfing buddies that his systems have 99.99% reliability. That would equal only 4.3 minutes of downtime a month.\\n\\nSo, how much would that extra nine cost? If going from 99.9% to 99.99% uptime cost only $10,000 a month, they would net an extra $320 a month. In this case, Google would probably invest the time and resources.\\n\\nHowever, if the cost of that extra nine was $100,000 a month, they would lose almost $90,000 a month. In this scenario, Google would not pursue 99.99% reliability. It’s simply not economical to make their website more reliable than it already is.\\n\\nPierce realized that creating the perfect pendulum was a never-ending quest. Google realized that creating a perfect service was a never-ending goal. Shewhart realized that creating a perfect manufacturing process was a never- ending process.\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200940\\n\\nYou have to find the pragmatic limits.\\n\\nA Show-Me State of Mind\\n\\nLet’s go back to C. I. Lewis’s two types of knowledge: a priori (drawing your conclusions beforehand) and a posteriori (drawing conclusions after the fact). Pragmatists dismiss a priori thinkers. In their view, you can’t know anything without starting first with some evidence.\\n\\nThis ties neatly into non-determinism: You can’t be certain the apple will hit the ground until you drop it and it hits the ground. Pragmatists wouldn’t assume that Schrödinger’s cat was dead or alive at all; they’d simply open the box. Let’s look at another instance of a priori thinking with a typical survey in my IT community of DevOps. An annual survey might send out a multi- ple-choice question such as, “On average, how often do you deliver software?” The choices might be:\\n\\nonce a year • once a month • once a week • once a day • once an hour\\n\\nBefore getting the answers back, the analysts behind the survey have already concluded that organizations delivering once an hour or a day should be categorized as “high performers.” Those delivering once a week or a month are “medium performers.” Those delivering once a year are “low performers.” The analysts draw their conclusions before even collecting the data. That’s a priori thinking.\\n\\nHowever, the reason a “low-performing” team might deploy only once a year could be because that’s when their space probe is within line of sight. That doesn’t make them low performing. You just can’t assume you know the answers ahead of time.\\n\\nA pragmatist, on the other hand, might ask the same question: “On aver- age, how often do you deliver software?” But instead of predetermining the responses, they might engage in a question-and-answer type of feedback:\\n\\nRespondent 1: “Every day, but it’s hard to do on Mondays and Fridays.” • Analyst: “Why is it hard on those days?” • Respondent 2: “Whenever it’s ready to be shipped.” • Analyst: “Do you need approval to deliver it?”\\n\\nCHAPTER 5: PRAGMATIST\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200941\\n\\nRespondent 3: “Only when my manager tells me I can.” • Analyst: “And when is that?”\\n\\nThe pragmatic analyst would collect the data and then draw conclusions about which software teams were high, medium, or low performers. That is, a posteriori, or after the fact.\\n\\nWhen Shewhart introduced Deming to the philosophy of pragmatism in 1927, the young protégé was amply prepared to receive it. Non-determinism had shown Ed that what “everyone” knew and accepted was either more nuanced or simply wrong. The only reliable source of knowledge came from empirical evi- dence. Pragmatism simply made sense. Ever thereafter, what Ed taught never came from tradition or hearsay but from hard facts and careful study.\\n\\nThe Shewhart Cycle & the Deming Wheel\\n\\nWalter Shewhart used the philosophy of pragmatism to completely rethink manufacturing. Most know the result of this today as the PDSA cycle (plan, do, study, act), what Ed called the Shewhart cycle. It has become the template to improve virtually every type of system or process:\\n\\n1. First, gather evidence to create a hypothesis: What needs to change? 2. Second, make the change. 3. Third, review what happened: Is the process better or worse? Why? 4. Last, decide where to go from here: Revert to before? Iterate further?\\n\\nBy continually gathering data, you can continually improve your process. My software developer, Bob, didn’t have this mentality. If he did, he would have experimented with his process of getting to work. Perhaps he could have planned to catch an earlier train. He could have experimented with taking his breakfast to go instead of buying it at the train station. Maybe by laying his clothes out the night before, he’d be able to leave his apartment sooner. He could have continu- ally experimented with all these variables to see if they helped shave some time off his commute so he could get to work closer to 8:00 a.m. instead of 8:15 a.m. Now, think of this on the scale of mass-manufacturing. There were one hundred thousand different parts and components to a Hawthorne Works tele- phone assemblage. Shewhart formalized a way to continually make incremental changes. Perhaps the managers found that replacing a machine’s rubber gas- ket every month instead of every other month reduced the number of no-gos produced. Or maybe a certain component made on a certain line got slightly\\n\\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200942\\n\\nmisaligned over time and needed to be checked more frequently than on other lines.\\n\\nThink about the shift in mentality. Before PDSA, the managers at Haw- thorne Works would look at the huge pile of scrap at the end of the day and say, “It is what it is. Sure wish we could find better workers.”\\n\\nWith PDSA, managers had a formal tool to help them track bad quality, make a change, and see if it improved product quality. They had a way to make Hawthorne Works better and better over time. They no longer made changes based on gut instinct; they had actual numbers to guide them. But Shewhart thought only in terms of manufacturing. It would be Deming who saw the bigger picture.\\n\\nCHAPTER 5: PRAGMATIST\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200943\\n\\nPart II\\n\\nApplications of Profound Knowledge\\n\\nWith his foundational ideas firmly formed, Deming took\\n\\nthe principles of Profound Knowledge he’d begun to glean and\\n\\nbegan to apply them to the real world, first at the US Census and\\n\\nthen in manufacturing supplies for World War II.

Kinetic theory of gases is a theory of probability.\\n\\n—W. Edwards Deming, in an interview with Nancy R. Mann\\n\\nWithin the USDA’s Bureau of Chemistry and Soils sat the innocuously named Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, the FNRL. Under the auspices of the USDA, it focused on improving farmland crop yields. Prior to 1921, however, it had been part of the US Department of War.\\n\\nBombs. They made bombs out of fertilizer. Well, actually, it was the other way around: the lab made fertilizer out of bombs. In World War I, the Germans had mastered the art of nitrogen-based explosives, giving them a decided advantage on the battlefield. The US wanted to catch up. By the time Deming took a job there, however, it had become a civilian-focused project. What had once been used for war was now being used for food.\\n\\nWhile Ed wouldn’t be awarded his PhD until 1928, he had finished all his coursework at Yale by 1927. He turned down job offers from Bell Labs (to the shock of many, I imagine; that’s like passing up an offer from NASA’s Jet Propul- sion Laboratory or Google). He could have joined government agencies working on weapons research. Instead, he took a position with the FNRL in Washington, DC, for less than half the pay he could have made in the private sector.\\n\\nI don’t have any evidence, but I would bet my bottom dollar his career choice was due to his upbringing. It was too late for the Deming family farm, but maybe he could help someone else. Maybe by increasing crop production he could help some other family avoid tarpaper shacks and candlelit prayers for food. Whatever his true motivation, Ed returned to his roots ten years after leaving the farm.\\n\\nDeming would live in Washington, DC, for the rest of his life. In the sum- mer of 1930, his wife, Agnes, returned home to Wyoming to see her parents. She contracted tuberculosis and by November she’d passed away. Deming was left a widower caring for their two-year-old adopted daughter, Dorothy. During that period, he continued working at the FNRL, frequently publishing papers along with the other researchers there. In an unusual move at the time, Deming\\n\\noften listed the office’s administrative assistant (tasked with preparing papers for publication) as a co-author. One Lola Shupe.\\n\\nIn 1932, however, that changed. Shupe would never again be listed as a coauthor or contributor on any subsequent papers for the rest of her natural life. Instead, she would be credited in her co-authored papers as Lola Deming. Ed had remarried.\\n\\nWhen Kevin dragged his grandfather upstairs to watch “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?” Grandma Lola was one of the few people in the coun- try who could fully appreciate—and fully understand—why her husband was being thrust into the national spotlight. For nearly fifty years, she’d been by his side, often literally, acting as a confidante and a true peer. Her work in statistics and her firsthand collaborations with Deming were important influences in his journey to understanding Profound Knowledge.\\n\\nShortly after Ed joined the FNRL, its deputy chief, Dr. Charles Kunsman, took the soon-to-be doctor under his wing. He was so impressed that he decided Ed simply had to meet his old colleague and flatmate: Shewhart. His flatmate and workmate had been Walter Shewhart.\\n\\nDr. Kunsman, as Deming would later say, “arranged for me many visits to Dr. Shewhart, the first one in the fall of 1927. In fact, I would claim that I had the privilege to work closer with Dr. Shewhart than anyone had in the Bell Laboratories.”1 The two men would collaborate and correspond over the next several decades, until Shewhart’s death in 1967.\\n\\nResearcher by Day, Teacher by Night\\n\\nBefore Agnes’s death in 1930, Ed had begun teaching courses at a sister orga- nization within the Department of Agriculture: the USDA Graduate School. At the time, it was essentially a continuing-education night school for govern- ment employees all over DC.\\n\\nWhen it opened its doors in October 1921, the school had been created expressly to further train USDA scientists. I don’t believe it was a coincidence that the FNRL had been transferred by an executive order from the Depart- ment of War to the USDA just three months earlier.\\n\\nIts entire course catalog fit onto one typewritten piece of paper:2\\n\\n1. Agricultural Economics 2. Statistical Methods 3. Biochemistry 4. Mycology 5. Plant Physiology\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200948\\n\\n6. Genetics 7. Physics of the Air 8. Statistical Mechanics Applied to Chemical Problems\\n\\nWith experience teaching at the college level already, Deming was a natural fit to become an instructor. At least as early as 1930, he began teaching courses on (what else?) mathematics and statistics.\\n\\nBut it was 1935 that might have been the most pivotal year in Deming’s life, as he met and studied with some of the most famous statisticians in his- tory, forever shaping his outlook and cementing his own place as a premier statistics researcher in the global community.\\n\\nThat year, Ed took a sabbatical from the USDA and FNLR to go study under Sir Ronald Fisher at University College London. Shewhart had done the same the year earlier, which I imagine is how Deming came by the opportunity.\\n\\nFisher was, by all accounts, brilliant. A mathematician, statistician, and geneticist, he’s been named “a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science”3 and is considered one of the three founders of population genetics. (Unfortunately, he would later come to be a staunch supporter of eugenics.)\\n\\nIt made sense that the USDA would encourage this exchange, as Fisher was one of the principal researchers at Rothamsted Experimental Station, about an hour north of London. Rothamsted was considered by many as the premier agricultural research site in the world. Founded in 1843, it continues to this day (with, in fact, a research project going on since 1856, the Park Grass Experiment). At Rothamsted, Deming would meet the Scottish statisticians Drs. William Gemmell Cochran and John Wishart. I surmise that during this time Fisher also introduced Deming (either in person or via correspondence) to the Polish statistician Jerzy Neyman. (Later, Neyman’s work would become the founda- tion for how the FDA tests medicines, including the COVID-19 vaccines.)\\n\\nAt the University College London, Ed also studied with Egon Pearson, a noted British statistician. Fisher, Cochran, and Wishart were agricultural statis- ticians. Egon, on the other hand, published The Application of Statistical Methods to Industrial Standardisation and Quality Control the year Deming was in London. This was the language of Deming’s mentor, Shewhart. Few people in the world were perhaps more prepared to absorb Egon’s teachings than Deming.*\\n\\nEgon was perhaps more famous for being the son of Karl Pearson, who founded the world’s\\n\\nfirst university statistics department there at University College London. Pearson senior died in 1936. I can’t help but wonder whether Egon took Deming to meet his father before Karl’s passing.\\n\\nCHAPTER 6: DR.

Fisher visited in 1936; Neyman, 1937. Cochran’s and Wishart’s visits were peppered in there at some point too.\\n\\nHe also invited his mentor, Dr. Shewhart, to give four afternoon lectures. With Neyman’s lecture, Deming had the Scotsman’s notes turned into a book that would become one of the first and most widely read textbooks on sta- tistics in the US, Lectures and Conferences on Mathematical Statistics. He wanted to do the same with Shewhart’s four lectures. But his mentor’s style of speaking and writing was . . . well, in Deming’s words, Shewhart had the “uncanny ability to make things difficult.”4 Shewhart was brilliant. Shewhart was an invaluable mentor. Shewhart was not a good teacher. The protégé had to basically strong- arm his mentor into allowing him to “edit” Shewhart’s thoughts. Eventually, in 1939, the Graduate School published Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control.\\n\\nDeming did more than study with and host noted statisticians. He advanced the field on his own as well, especially with a new method called sta- tistical sampling: the science of using a few people in a group to learn about everyone in the group. Through his courses at the Graduate School, Deming’s influence seeped into the departments and agencies throughout the federal government—and one in particular: the US Census Bureau.\\n\\nThe Leap from Manufacturing to Bureaucracy\\n\\nBy 1939, there was a conflict within the US Census Bureau. On one side sat Deming’s acolytes. They believed statistical sampling was the way forward. Done right, a small sample group could act as stand-ins for everybody. The old guard (being the old guard) naturally wanted to keep counting every man, woman, and child. Deming said, “Sampling was abhorred because the census had always been complete. It couldn’t be anything other than complete. But sampling was in the air.”5\\n\\nThe debate was so intense that Secretary of Commerce* Harry Hopkins had to weigh in. After he ruled in favor of sampling, Assistant Chief Statistician for Population Dr. Philip Hauser offered the former farm boy a job. The Census was\\n\\nThe Bureau of the Census is part of the Department of Commerce because . . . who knows? It was its own office from 1840 to 1902, when it became part of the Department of the Interior. In 1903, it became part of Teddy Roosevelt’s new Department of Commerce and Labor. When Labor left to become its own department in 1913, Commerce got to keep the Census. Presum- ably, they negotiated visiting rights.\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200950\\n\\ngoing to use sampling in the national survey next year—would Deming come on board?\\n\\nWhy, yes. Yes, he would. At this time, the Census had 1,750 keypunch operators and inspectors on the payroll. The operators’ job was to take in the Census data from all over the country and convert it into punch cards.* The inspectors’ job was to verify that every single punch card had the data correctly entered.\\n\\nThe piecework compensation method used at factories around the nation showed up again here. The operators got paid by how many punch cards they processed. Just like at Hawthorne and factories all over, this forced workers to focus on speed instead of quality. The punch cards were, unsurprisingly, error prone. The inspectors, knowing that their coworkers were paid according to how many correct punch cards they processed, would often overlook their friends’ mistakes.\\n\\nThe US Constitution mandates a countrywide population census take place every ten years. The survey does more than tell us how many people live in the US. It determines how the 435 seats in the US House of Representatives get divvied up. That in itself is a fairly big deal. The bigger a state’s congressio- nal delegation, the more clout and influence it has in how the largest economy with the most powerful military force in the history of humankind is run.\\n\\nIf that weren’t enough for you: the census also decides who becomes pres- ident. Every grammar school student knows that whichever candidate wins the popular vote doesn’t matter. The Oval Office goes to the person who wins the most electoral college votes. Each state gets so many electoral votes based on how many people it sends to Congress: two senators plus however many representa- tives it has. In the 2020 census, eighty-nine people in New York cost their state a seat in the House. Had they filled out their census forms, the state would have maintained its population (on paper, at least) and therefore kept its number of US representatives and the associated electoral votes.\\n\\nOut west, however, plenty of people filled out their census forms—so many that the census counted a big enough population bump in Montana to give the state another seat in Congress. As the state had only one seat in the House at the time, this was an enormous increase in political clout and influence for Montana. Power shifted from a traditionally liberal state to a historically con- servative one. All because of eighty-nine people.\\n\\nYou do not want data-entry mistakes when inputting census data.\\n\\nIf you saw or read Hidden Figures, you’ll recall that these punch cards were how we ran calcula-\\n\\ntions on early computers.\\n\\nCHAPTER 6: DR.

Statistical process control, as we noted in earlier chapters, is based on the premise that no matter what the system is, its output will vary (the The- ory of Variation). The first thing Deming needed to do was establish tolerance (a.k.a. control) limits.\\n\\nNext, he sampled 5% of operators’ work to determine which operators worked within the control limits and identify the ones whose work fell outside the limits. These underperforming operators were pulled out of their work and retrained. They, as well as brand-new operators, would have 100% of their work inspected until their work fell within the control limits. The Bureau would con- tinue to sample 5% of all the operators’ work to verify the system as a whole stayed “in control.”\\n\\nAlong the way, Ed identified a colossal waste of talent. Previously, the best keypunch operators were promoted to become inspectors. With the new sampling system in place, the Bureau no longer needed its best and brightest performing inspections. These star performers were rotated back into punch card operations, especially to fill in for those undergoing further training.\\n\\nUp until now, statistical process control had been used solely for manufac- turing. That’s what Shewhart created it for. Deming’s genius was in realizing that it could be used anywhere. You don’t get much further from a dirty factory floor mass-producing telephones than a government office of (almost certainly all) women quietly converting raw figures into computer punch cards. But being the systems-thinker he was, Deming saw how to take Shewhart’s principles and translate them into this foreign world.\\n\\nShewhart gave us a way to continually improve a process. • Deming gave us a way to continually improve a system. • Shewhart showed us how to optimize an existing process. • Deming showed us how to rethink the process altogether. • Shewhart used statistics to improve manufacturing. • Deming used statistics to improve everything.\\n\\nAnd it worked, saving the Bureau $263,000 annually—roughly $5 million today. More importantly, it made the census counts more accurate, leading to a more representative and fairer democracy in the US.\\n\\nWith the successful introduction of statistical analysis into the US Census system, Deming took the first dramatic step toward generalizing Shewhart’s methods beyond manufacturing to all systems thinking. The expansion of the applicability of statistical process control to any system was the next major\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200952\\n\\nmilestone in Ed’s journey to discovering Profound Knowledge. Subsequent suc- cessful implementations of these new concepts made a name for Ed as one of the preeminent thinkers in the field of statistical analysis and set him fully on the road to revolutionizing systems thinking.

Her feet ached from walking the streets of Manhattan all day; her face was chapped by the winter winds that the skyscrapers funneled through the steel canyons. Up until a few months ago, her life had been pretty good. Carefree, even. The Great Depression had been devastating for many Americans. Fortunately, Virginia’s family was spared most of it. In fact, it was her father at the front of the train. As one of the handful of steadily paid people in the city, he could have turned his income into a small fortune. Instead, he used his paychecks to support his extended family as well as close friends.\\n\\nBecause of his job, Virginia’s (my mother’s) family was well off enough to afford her an all-girls private high school and courses in stenography, typ- ing, and clerical work there in Brooklyn. Almost since birth, her blood had run Brooklyn Dodgers blue. The Dodgers called Ebbets Field home there at the southeast corner of Prospect Park. Virginia’s family lived a few blocks east.\\n\\nDuring the 1930s, Dr. Walter Shewhart and his young family lived just a few blocks south of the park. If we had a time machine, I wouldn’t be surprised to find them both sitting in the stands rooting for their home team—especially in October of 1941, just a few months before Virginia’s train ride. The Dodgers played the World Series (the first Subway Series) against the New York Yankees there in Ebbets Field. For the last two months, Virginia and her fellow Brook- lynites had comforted each other after the Dodgers lost, shouting “Dem bums!” and “Wait’ll next year!” in the streets.\\n\\nMiss Virginia Moriarty (no relation to Sherlock Holmes’s archnemesis) had graduated that summer. Her parents pressured her to “marry up,” but Virginia had other plans. In spite of the ongoing Great Depression, and in addition to the challenges of being a woman in the workplace in the 1940s, the twenty- one-year-old from Brooklyn was determined to make it on her own.\\n\\nThat had been almost six months ago. Riding the train home to Brooklyn that bleak Friday afternoon in December, she had decidedly less confidence. Despite her high marks, her obvious ambition and self-motivation, and her determined spirit, she had nothing to show after months of walking the streets of New York job hunting.\\n\\nGoing home empty-handed yet again wasn’t going to be fun. Applying for jobs during business hours let her keep her mind occupied. In the evenings, she could escape up to her room quickly.\\n\\nIt was the weekends she dreaded. Her parents, wanting only the best for their little girl, constantly needled her to focus on starting a family, not a career. During the Great Depression, when so many men were out of work (shrinking the pool of eligible bachelors) and every penny of household income counted, paying for vocational training for their daughter had seemed like a smart choice. But when it came down to reality, they didn’t want Virginia to make a living; they wanted her to make a life. After half a year of wearing out heels and hosiery, the young woman had begun to lose hope that she could choose her own fate, she later told me. Like the princess in a typical fairytale, it seemed she was trapped where she was.\\n\\nLittle did Miss Moriarty know, sitting in that train seat bundled in her best winter coat, that her life would change that weekend. And not just hers, everyone’s. In fact, the whole world would change that weekend. You see, that following Sunday was December 7, 1941.\\n\\nPearl Harbor.\\n\\nWomen Go to Work\\n\\nOver the course of the war, the US drafted over 11.5 million men to serve in the armed forces; another 6.3 million volunteered. Deming’s 1940 census counted about 133 million Americans total. Of these, nearly 18 million servicemen (including over 350,000 servicewomen) represented a notable part of the pop- ulation and an especially notable part of those in the labor force. So much so that barely a year after instituting the 1941 draft, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9279 barring any more eighteen-to-thirty- seven-year-old men from volunteering to serve. The country couldn’t afford to lose any more laborers. The nation had no choice but to turn to an overlooked and underutilized resource: a ready and willing workforce of millions of women. At a Navy manufacturing facility in San Francisco, just a few months into the war, an Acme photographer touring the plant snapped a shot of one such woman operating a Pratt & Whitney lathe. When he later developed it, he wrote on the back\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200956\\n\\nMarch 24, 1942\\n\\nNaval Air Station Alameda Pretty Naomi Parker looks like she might catch her nose in the tur- ret lathe she is operating, but she knows to keep her nose out of her business.1*\\n\\nThe twenty-year-old young woman had volunteered almost immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She found work at the Naval Air Station there in Alameda, in the middle of San Francisco Bay. She and other such newcomers assembled US Navy aircraft.\\n\\nThat photograph was supposed to be used as a “what to wear” poster for the millions of women entering the workforce for the first time; however, it would go on to be syndicated in a number of newspapers throughout the coun- try, including the Pittsburgh Press, home of Westinghouse Electric.\\n\\nAn artist working for Westinghouse was tasked with creating propaganda posters. The company wanted to inspire (or, at least, motivate) the swelling women workforce to remember their patriotic duty (and to please not go on strike, organize a union, or make any other such trouble). The print he created bore a striking resemblance to Naomi’s photograph. The company printed the posters and hung them in production areas for all of two weeks. But the image would become world famous: Rosie the Riveter.\\n\\nLittle did Naomi know how much of an influence Deming had on her life.\\n\\nMass-Producing Victory\\n\\nA few months after Naomi’s inspiring photograph was taken, Virginia Moriarty found a naval wartime production job too. Just three miles north of Ebbets Field sat the Brooklyn Navy Yard, between Flushing Avenue and the East River. It had been established in 1806 and served as a US Navy shipyard, both build- ing and repairing naval ships.\\n\\nAt the time of Virginia’s Friday subway ride, the shipyard employed around eighteen thousand men.2 By that June, its workforce had grown to a staggering forty-two thousand.3 Of course, the Navy Yard faced the same labor shortages as every other employer. Between volunteers and draftees, the pool of available working men had shrunk. Somewhere around this time, the US Civil Service allowed women to apply for mechanic jobs for the first time. Some twenty\\n\\nI have no idea if the photographer was referring to her physical safety or making some misog- ynistic joke about women in the workplace.

Of those, six thousand were consid- ered; half were deemed eligible; two hundred were offered a position.4\\n\\nAmong them, one Virginia Moriarty. When she arrived, however, she discovered they wouldn’t allow her to work in the yard building ships, in the foundries, or even in the paint shop. Instead, Virginia found herself in the ship- yard’s offices. Her stenography, typing, and other clerical skills finally found a home, one far more fulfilling than she’d ever dreamed. As one of the first members of the swelling administrative staff (it would eventually include 2,300 women5), she was an integral part of the bureaucracy that kept operations running smoothly. The papers that came across her desk encompassed work related to building the aircraft carriers USS Bennington and the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt as well as the battleships USS Iowa and USS Missouri—the legendary “Mighty Mo” that was the setting of Japan’s surrender years later.*\\n\\nOf the millions of Rosies and Virginias joining the industrial workforce for the first time, they—unskilled, minimally trained, and entering organizations that had never hired women before—managed to produce munitions, newly designed aircraft, battleships that survived multiple wars, tanks that advanced across Europe, and Army jeeps climbing over hostile terrain in the Pacific.\\n\\nBut how did any US worker manage to quickly adapt to converted factories and new technologies while doubling, tripling, or quadrupling production and simultaneously increasing production quality? The answer lies with Deming and is largely considered the reason the Allies won the war.\\n\\nIn 1939, the US had a standing army smaller than Romania’s: just 630,000. Contrast that against Germany’s and Japan’s four million combined. Just as the US had sat on the sidelines in World War I (joining only at the very end), it wanted to stay out of the second one. Winston Churchill believed that Europe— and, by extension, democracy as a whole—was doomed without US support. While FDR was sympathetic to England’s plight, the law strictly forbade him from directly supplying the Allied Powers. Adolf Hitler didn’t believe it would matter, anyway. He once said, “An American intervention by mass deliveries of planes and war materials will not change the outcome of the war.”6\\n\\nNaomi, Virginia, and Ed would prove him wrong. Factories all over the country converted from making everyday items to producing war supplies. The Lionel Toy Train company switched over to manufacturing maritime supplies such as compasses.

Ford Motor Company created B-24 Liberator bombers. Even the Mattatuck Manufacturing Company making something as mundane as upholstery nails converted to manufacturing rifle cartridge clips. When General Dwight Eisenhower toured the beaches of Normandy* after D-day, it looked like a cyclone had torn through an industrial-sized scrapy- ard. The invasion included fifty thousand vehicles, over five thousand ships, and ten thousand airplanes. The beaches were littered with the bullet-rid- dled and burnt-out remains of troop transports, amphibious assault vehicles, flamethrower armored cars, and the fuselages of fighters and bombers. The battlefield represented the manufactured output of millions of American workers back home. In a devastating tribute to Naomi’s, Virginia’s, and Ed’s efforts, Eisenhower wrote in his memoirs, “There was no sight in the war that so impressed me with the industrial might of America as the wreckage on the landing beaches.”7\\n\\nAfter the war, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin would raise a toast: “Without\\n\\nAmerican production the United Nations could never have won the war.”8\\n\\nMass production won the war. But not by using the production processes of the past. No, US industry vastly scaled production while simultaneously improving quality through statistical process control and statistical sampling.\\n\\nThe Stanford Classes\\n\\nAbout a month after Naomi’s photograph was taken and twenty-five miles south, an economics professor sat at his typewriter. He’d felt the same patriotic call as Naomi and Virginia. Recounting the moment years later, he wrote,\\n\\nAs one of several statisticians . . . seeking some way that we at Stanford could contribute to the war effort, I wrote on April 17, 1942, to a friend in Washington, W. Edwards Deming of the Census Bureau, that “those of us teaching statistics in various departments here are trying to work out a curriculum adapted to the immediate statistical requirements of the war. It seems probable that a good many students with research training might by training in statistics become more useful for war than in their present work . . . 9\\n\\nHis letter continued,\\n\\nMy family and I once went to Normandy, where my son flew a drone over the water to recreate what the soldiers might have seen coming in from the Channel. Standing there, we could feel the winds of history.\\n\\nCHAPTER 7: ROSIE & WORLD WAR II\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200959\\n\\nIt is difficult for us to design such a program because we do not have a picture of the statistical work of the war. You are probably in as good a position as anyone to observe what kinds of statistical training are needed for a wide variety of purposes. It may not be possible to make any generalizations, but if it is we would try to put them to enough use to justify the time and trouble of advising us.10\\n\\nWhile Ed was still officially employed by the Census Bureau, he was “loaned” to the Secretary of the War Department two to three days a week. When he replied to the professor seven days later, the stationery bore “the let- terhead of the Chief of Ordnance, War Department,” the office he had been assigned to.\\n\\nDeming wrote,\\n\\nHere is my idea. Time and materials are at a premium, and there is no time to be lost. There is no royal short cut to producing a highly trained statistician, but I do firmly believe that the most important principles of application can be expounded in a very short time to engineers and others. I have done it and have seen it done. You could accomplish a great deal by holding a school in the Shewhart methods some time in the near future. . . .\\n\\nI would suggest that [the] courses be thrown open to engineers, inspectors, and industrial people with or without mathematical and sta- tistical training. . . . 11\\n\\nYears later, the economics professor would recall: “On May 1, I was able to write to Deming that, ‘Your letter arrived a few hours ago . . . . The specific suggestions struck home so well that Holbrook Working (Chairman of the Uni- versity Committee on Statistics) has already talked with two or three of the key people and arranged a general meeting of everyone in statistics’. ”12\\n\\nIn a 1942 issue of Science magazine, Dr. Holbrook Working wrote,\\n\\nSuitable machinery for organizing and financing the suggested course was already in existence in the . . .

Two Professors, Eugene L. Grant and Holbrook Working . . . and Dr. W Edwards Deming from the Census Bureau worked together in each course. A fourth man on the staff for each course was drawn from indus- try to present the point of view of a man meeting, from day to day, the practical problems of applying the methods under discussion.13\\n\\nEd taught twenty-seven of the classes himself. Some two thousand men and women from seven hundred companies took part in these courses. Many of them, in turn, became instructors and gave more classes to more compa- nies and industries throughout the country. All told, some thirty-one thousand engineers, supervisors, managers, and workers went through the course, tak- ing statistical process control back to their factories, manufacturing plants, and assembly lines all over the US to create more and better weapons and supplies for the war effort.*\\n\\nBut according to the American general who oversaw the domestic war pro- duction effort, the Allies didn’t win because of D-day or the atom bomb. The Axis powers didn’t lose because of a misstep or overreaching. Victory came because the US outproduced the rest of the world. As noted previously, by the end of the war, the US had supplied two-thirds of the Allies’ military needs. The quantity—and, perhaps more importantly, the quality—of American manufac- tured goods had risen dramatically.\\n\\nThe Allies won the war because of Rosie, and Rosie succeeded in no small\\n\\npart thanks to Deming’s course in manufacturing statistical process control.†\\n\\nImportantly for Ed’s journey to Profound Knowledge, the Stanford classes demonstrated once again that the theory of variation and the theory of knowl- edge could work in virtually any industry with the same results: increased quality, decreased waste, and an ever-improving system.\\n\\nThis also laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the American Society for\\n\\nQuality.\\n\\n† Deming doesn’t get all the credit, however. There was also the Training Within Industry (TWI) program designed to help Rosie rapidly learn the basic skills needed to take over a job from the previous worker. TWI allowed Rosie to keep the level of production and quality the previous workers achieved; the Stanford classes and the military standards covered in the next chapter allowed Rosie to supersede those levels. She needed both to succeed.\\n\\nCHAPTER 7: ROSIE & WORLD WAR II\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200961\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nCLASSIFIED\\n\\nIt is not enough to do your best; you must know what to do, and then do your best.\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming\\n\\nIn Chapter 1, we briefly touched on a foundational element of Profound Knowledge: systems thinking. I have heard one person explain the concept this way: “Systems thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts. It has been used as a way of exploring and developing effective action in complex contexts.”1 It’s not a method like statistical process control or the PDSA cycle. It’s a whole different way of seeing, of thinking. But why is it important? Because not only does it improve industrial nations, but it actually saves lives and averts tragedy.\\n\\nI once asked one of the leading cloud architects at Netflix how he changed the company’s IT culture. He told me he bought two books. He gave the first one, Release It!, to all his software developers. The book is about IT architecture and adaptability. That is, how do you run software in a complex and unpre- dictable world? The author is a friend, Mike Nygard, who (as of this writing) is redesigning SABRE. This giant IBM mainframe computer is more than half a century old, yet it’s the ticket reservation system for fifty-plus airlines. Every time you scan your plane ticket, the airline’s system pings SABRE.\\n\\nThe second book he bought was Drift into Failure by Sidney Dekker, which he passed out to all his IT infrastructure and operations people. Dekker’s book forces organizational managers to rethink blame and accountability in complex processes. When something goes wrong, it asks, “Should you blame the per- son? Or is it the system?”2*\\n\\nIt was Dekker’s book Drift into Failure that a retired Air Force fighter pilot\\n\\ngrabbed on his way out the door one January morning.\\n\\nSeeing as how he and Deming were on the same wavelengths, I suggested Dekker look at\\n\\nDeming’s work. I was gratified when I saw Deming crop up in Dekker’s next book, The Safety Anarchist.\\n\\nSystems Thinking on the Hudson\\n\\nThe retired air force captain never kissed his wife before going on a work trip. At least, not at 5:30 in the morning. She was a light sleeper; better to softly whisper goodbye. He departed from San Francisco, electronically pinging the SABRE mainframe like everyone else before boarding the plane.\\n\\nHe preferred to sit in the back, alone if possible, so he could read undis- turbed. As a former airman, he was particularly interested in Dekker’s work, as Dekker regularly wrote about aviation safety and complex systems resilience.\\n\\nAfter arriving in New York and concluding some business, he boarded another plane, this time headed for North Carolina. But for this flight, he found himself at the front of the 150-passenger plane, in the cockpit. Shortly after the wheels left LaGuardia’s tarmac, it sounded as if the plane had sud- denly found itself in a thunderstorm, with hail pelting the fuselage. The retired fighter pilot immediately recognized what was about to happen.\\n\\nThey were going down. While serving, Captain “Sully” Sullenberger had been on the US Air Force’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Board. He knew that its civilian counterpart, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), had something of a reputa- tion for how they investigated accidents like the one he was in the middle of. Though it wouldn’t take place for another five years, a fine example is Asiana Flight 214. On its approach to the San Francisco airport, the plane crashed. Forty-nine people were seriously injured; three died. The NTSB ruled it pilot error.\\n\\nThe problem with such “Monday-morning quarterback” investigations is that the investigators use what’s called counterfactual thinking. This is kind of like thinking of the perfect comeback a day later. The NTSB, and others like it, have all the information plus the luxury of time to think through all the possi- bilities: “Well, why didn’t you think of doing this instead of that?”\\n\\nThis thinking doesn’t take into account that, in the thick of things, people are dealing with bounded rationality, a theory created by Herbert Simon, who worked in the field of cognitive psychology. We’re not computers that can run every possible scenario in a matter of milliseconds. Humans can process only so much information at a time. When we get in a car wreck, our reactions are more instinctual than rational. After the fact, we can look back and say, “Why didn’t I just pull the steering wheel to the left? I would have missed the other car completely!”\\n\\nBut in the middle of it, we can do only what we can do. Instead of counterfactual thinking, Deming was an advocate of systems thinking. Before blaming the Asiana pilots on Flight 214, Deming would have\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200964\\n\\nlooked at the bigger picture. Did they receive adequate training? Had this set of conditions been anticipated?\\n\\nIn fact, the NTSB did list two such “contributing factors”: Boeing had done a bad job documenting its complex flight system and Asiana Airlines’ training programs were lacking. Those pilots weren’t set up for success, especially not in such extraordinary conditions.\\n\\nIt was the same story for the Miracle on the Hudson. I would go so far as to say that if our retired air force pilot—one Captain Sully—weren’t a systems thinker, US Airways Flight 1549 might have had a much darker ending. Fortunately for the 150 passengers, three flight atten- dants, and the copilot, Sully was.\\n\\nWhen the plane plowed into the flock of Canadian geese—some of them as heavy as eighteen pounds—it’d been in the air for only ninety-seven seconds. It had climbed to only three thousand feet. Sully lost not one but both engines. That virtually never happens. In almost twenty thousand hours of flight time, he’d never lost one engine, much less two. The most studied incident in avia- tion is bird strikes, not engine failure.*\\n\\nFrom wheels up to splash down was all of five minutes. During those min- utes, Sully had to react to geese literally coming through the cockpit windshield, assess the damage, mitigate the fuel leaking from the now-defunct engines, keep control of the plane while his copilot grabbed the emergency procedures binder, and assess his options. Because of a US Airways cost-cutting measure, the geniuses back at corporate decided the emergency binder didn’t need num- bered tabs—that they could save a few pennies per binder by printing the page numbers only on the individual pages. Pilots could just flip through and find the right page. You know, at their leisure.\\n\\nWhile his copilot was desperately trying to find the correct procedure, Sully was on the radio making a mayday call. It would take seventeen seconds before the air traffic controller could give him the all-clear to circle back and land at LaGuardia Runway 31. During those intervening sixteen seconds, Sully had to continually assess and reassess all his options.\\n\\nIdeally, he’d make it back to LaGuardia and glide in. (Again, fortunately for the passengers and crew, he’d been part of an experimental glider program in the Air Force.) If not, could he make it to New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport? He radioed the controllers, asking for options. A ground landing was out of the question: they would crash into the Bronx. And, as a last resort, what about landing on the Hudson River?\\n\\nFor you tech geeks: John Allspaw of Adaptive Capacity Labs says bird strikes are aviation’s\\n\\nversion of the “Hello, World!” program.\\n\\nCHAPTER 8: CLASSIFIED\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200965\\n\\nThing was, no one had ever attempted landing a passenger plane with zero power by gliding into a river. Because of his glider training, if anyone were going to attempt it, Sully was probably the best option. But even if he could safely glide into the waters, could they evacuate the plane before it sank like a stone? And even if they could, it was January. Remember, most of the passen- gers on the Titanic didn’t die from drowning but from hypothermia. Were there enough ferries and water taxis on the river at 3:30 in the afternoon to come to rescue everyone before they succumbed to exposure?\\n\\nAnd all this while simultaneously piloting a plane powered solely by\\n\\nmomentum.\\n\\nAt the seventeen-second mark from the mayday call, LaGuardia control told him they had the runway cleared . . . but Sully knew it was already too late. He wouldn’t have enough power to turn and maintain airspeed that long. Teter- boro came back: They were ready to receive. He thought they might be able to make it, but then: “We can’t do it. . . . We’re gonna be in the Hudson.”3 He ditched the plane not too far upriver from 463 West Street.* Now, in the Hollywood version of this, the NTSB did try to pin this all on Sully. After examining the facts, he could have returned to LaGuardia or made it on to Teterboro. At the very least, he had enough time to ditch the plane in the East River near LaGuardia, where the airport was prepared for such water landings. Had he put the passengers in unnecessary danger? It was a witch- hunt, and they were out to sully Sully’s good name.\\n\\nInstead of arguing with them, Tom Hanks—ahem—Sully demonstrated what bounded rationality decision-making looked like. He took them through a flight simulator, showing them how mind-bogglingly complex the situation was. As a human in the thick of it, he didn’t have access to every single piece of information. He didn’t have the luxury of time to make all the calculations for all of his options in order to settle on the optimal course of action.\\n\\nOne of Dekker’s mentors, Dr. David Woods, describes complex situations like the Three Mile Island disaster and the space shuttle tragedies of the Chal- lenger and the Columbia like this: “Anomaly response situations frequently involve time pressure, multiple interacting goals, high consequences of fail- ure, and multiple interleaved tasks.”4 Put another way, Sully walked the NTSB through looking at a complex system made even more complicated by having to evaluate, decide, and execute a life-or-death strategy in a matter of minutes, all while keeping the plane aloft.\\n\\nIn real life, the NTSB praised his actions. One official called it “the most successful ditching in aviation history.”5 On December 2, 2021, Sully was con-\\n\\n*Walter Shewhart’s ghost at the former Western Electric Building nodded approvingly.\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200966\\n\\nfirmed as the United States Ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization.\\n\\nIn one article, he answered a reporter’s question this way: “One way of looking at this might be that for forty-two years, I’ve been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education, and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal.”6\\n\\nI would add to that statement “and that’s because I am a systems thinker.” For forty-two years, he’d wrestled with complex problems and systems think- ing, especially in aviation control and safety, as his own blog attests to. In addition to his nearly twenty-thousand hours of flight time, I can’t imagine how many hours Sully “logged” in his own mind, simulating disaster and how he might react. He’d trained himself to operate in a complex environment with multiple interconnected variables.\\n\\nSully was a systems thinker . . . and that’s how he performed a miracle. This is a real-life example of how an appreciation for systems from the System of Profound Knowledge can save lives and avert disaster. However, this story barely scratches the surface of the concept’s impact. To truly appre- ciate that, we need a crash course in the history and development of the concept.\\n\\nFrom Systems Thinking to Silicon Valley\\n\\nI doubt Sully realized it, but his way of systems thinking was heavily influenced by a Nazi. Well, a soon-to-be-Nazi, anyway: Dr. Ludwig von von Bertalanffy. The biologist is credited as one of the founders of “general systems theory.” As we covered in Chapter 1 on deterministic thinking, before then, conventional science in the West tried to reduce everything down to its component parts. The idea was that if you could understand the individual pieces, you could understand the bigger picture.\\n\\nBiology taught von Bertalanffy that the sum is greater than the whole of its parts. For instance, during the Black Plague, everyone thought cats were bad omens, so they killed as many as they could. As it turns out, with- out cats, the population of rats that were actually carrying the bubonic plague exploded. (Where have we heard this story before?) Everything is connected to everything else. You’ve heard of the butterfly effect? A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil and through a complex chain of events causes a tornado in Texas? It’s like that.\\n\\nSupported by the Rockefeller Foundation, von Bertalanffy studied in the US with a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago and then at\\n\\nCHAPTER 8: CLASSIFIED\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200967\\n\\na marine laboratory about seventy-five miles south of Boston before Hitler annexed his homeland of Austria in 1938. Despite attempts to stay in the US, he was forced to return, whereupon he promptly embraced Nazi ideology.* Just before he left, however, he gave a lecture wherein the audience included one Russell Ackoff and a W. Edwards Deming, who was still teaching at the USDA Graduate School.\\n\\nAfter the Axis powers lost, von Bertalanffy became a sort of wandering professor, teaching at the University of London, then in Montreal and Ottawa before heading to the University of Southern California. In 1954 at Berkeley, along with another biologist, an economist, and a mathematician, he founded what would become the Society for General Systems Research, which formal- ized the field of systems thinking and became the nucleus for preeminent thinkers from different disciplines to cross-pollinate ideas and look at the world in different ways. Some of the members directly influenced Deming’s system thinking.\\n\\nThe Society would come to have some quite notable scholars among its ranks. Margaret Mead, for instance, who catalyzed the sexual revolution of the 1960s. She would serve as president in 1972. Then there was Ross Ashby, known for Ashby’s Law. He would mentor Herbert Simon—he was the one who coined the concept of bounded rationality—as well as Norbert Wiener, who would become the father of cybernetics. Von Bertalanffy also influenced Aldous Huxley (the author of Brave New World) as well as Abraham Maslow (of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs). He served as president of the Society in 1962. Then there’s Russell Ackoff—Ackoff would be president in 1987—Deming’s friend at the Census who was also the close friend of Peter Drucker, the “father of modern management.” Ackoff’s early work on management provided the core of much of Drucker’s teachings. All this to say that the influence of sys- tems thinking is, as we can see, far-reaching.\\n\\nBut systems thinking had already taken root in the US before von Berta- lanffy went home for the war, showing up in the Macy Conferences,† founded in 1941, then later in the Macy Conferences specifically dedicated to cybernet- ics. To fully understand Deming’s thinking around an appreciation of systems, however, we need to talk about radar.\\n\\nWithin two years of Hitler’s annexation of Austria in 1938, the Axis Powers controlled continental Europe.

The British were developing their own radar systems and countermeasures as quickly as possible. Even though the US was still officially neutral, those in power could see the handwriting on the wall. The US was quite amenable to exchanging wartime technology, especially because the British and Germans were already so far ahead in fields like radar research.\\n\\nTwo months after agreeing to a tech exchange, the British researcher Henry Tizard landed on American shores with top-secret technology: the res- onant cavity magnetron. The small device emitted pulses of short radio waves, making it ideal to install on aircraft and ships.\\n\\nA researcher named Vannevar Bush wanted more direct action. During World War I, the electrical engineer designed a device to detect German sub- marines. In 1919, he joined MIT’s faculty, and in 1922, he founded Raytheon, still one of the US’s top defense contractors. But Bush was frustrated by the arm’s-length relationship between academia and the US military. At that time, scientists and academics would discover and invent things according to their own research. The military would then evaluate these inventions and innova- tions to see if they had possible military applications.\\n\\nBush thought it should be the other way around: Uncle Sam should spon- sor academic research specifically aimed to create military technologies. Two months before the Battle of Britain began, he presented a one-page memo to that effect to President Roosevelt, who immediately approved the creation of the National Defense Research Committee. This was a major contributor to what would become known as the military-industrial complex.\\n\\nThree months after the Committee’s formation, Henry Tizard would arrive with the magnetron. Bush promptly established the Radiation Laboratory (or “Rad Lab”)* at MIT to capitalize on and further the development of the tech- nology. The Rad Lab would go on to create 150 different radar systems for the war effort, including interception radars for fighter planes at night, fire-control radars for antiaircraft guns, warning radars, and to Bush’s delight, I’m sure, antisubmarine radars.\\n\\nAs part of their research on radar systems, Bush and his colleague Harold Locke Hazen created the “differential analyzer”—the first computer capable of solving differential equations, a.k.a. calculus. The differential analyzer was quickly put to use in conjunction with ballistic research (missile systems). Claude Shannon, the person who would become the “father of information\\n\\nIt was at the Rad Lab that Percy Spencer, an engineer working with the magnetron, would\\n\\nnotice a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted.

The infamous Army Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. The director of ballistics research was a soldier-scientist named Captain Leslie Simon. Simon would later publish the book German Research in World War II, outlining how the Nazis conducted their research.\\n\\nUnder the War Department, the FNRL had been part of the Ordnance Department. Deming and Captain Simon had a mutual acquaintance in Dr. Walter Shewhart; he introduced the two to each other at dinner one night at his house. Apparently, Deming and Simon hit it off. Simon eventually convinced the Census Bureau to loan him the statistician on a part-time basis to assist him and his troops as they tested manufacturers’ mass-produced weapons before shipping them to the front lines.\\n\\nI wonder if Ed knew he was witnessing history in the making. The differen- tial analyzer was the predecessor of ENIAC,* the first digital computer, created expressly to calculate ballistics for tests at Aberdeen. The idea came from two University of Pennsylvania engineers, John Mauchly and John Eckert, but was initially rejected by the National Defense Research Committee. Knowing Cap- tain Leslie Simon was an innovator and researcher at heart, the two engineers reached out to him. He gave them the quiet go-ahead. Simon and Aberdeen were directly responsible for the rise of digital computing.\\n\\nComing back to Bush: at the Rad Lab, he and Norbert Wiener—recall the latter as one of von Bertalanffy’s followers—created the antiaircraft predictor. This sort of mini computer could calculate airplane design, physics, a pilot’s assumed thought processes, ambient temperature, and even humidity to pre- dict where an airplane would be. If you knew that, you could fire an antiaircraft missile to intercept its path. Eventually, this was attached to the missile itself. As the missile neared its target, variables would change, temperature and wind speed, for instance. Wiener created a system of feedback loops between the computer and the guidance system. The more quickly it could calculate the vari- ables, the more quickly it could self-correct.\\n\\nVon Bertalanffy introduced the basics of systems thinking, which in turn spawned cybernetics. Ed’s work at Aberdeen with Leslie Simon baptized Ed with an appreciation of systems, otherwise known as systems thinking. Simon’s\\n\\nInteresting fact: the original software programmers of the ENIAC were six women: Jean\\n\\nBartik, Betty Holberton, Ruth Teitelbaum, Kathleen Antonelli, Marlyn Meltzer, and Frances Spence. They were the software equivalent of the Rosies welding airplanes and riveting battleships.\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200970\\n\\nand Wiener’s work on radar solidified Ed’s understanding of feedback loops, an essential tool in applying the Theory of Knowledge.\\n\\nWiener continued his research after the war, developing the science of cybernetics. In a phrase, this is the science of feedback. The antiaircraft predic- tor, in a sense, taught itself as it sought its target. For Wiener, cybernetics would come to include how the human mind and body worked too. The purpose of any feedback system is to compensate for variability, whether that be a patient’s insulin levels, a change in environmental conditions, or a rocket’s flight path. The quicker the feedback, the quicker the system can react to change.*\\n\\nAs mentioned, in 1941 the Macy Conferences kicked off. It was a kind of communal learning experience as scientists—and especially boundary span- ners, who were trained or experienced in multiple, divergent fields—shared their works in progress. It was a massive cross-pollination and exchange of ideas. In 1946, the Macy Cybernetics Conferences began, influencing some of the most influential thinkers of our time, including Donella Meadows and Peter Senge (both at MIT).†\\n\\nI’d be remiss in telling this chain of events if I didn’t mention the Har- vard Radio Research Lab, an outgrowth of MIT’s Rad Lab. Its director, Fred Terman, developed electronic countermeasures to enemy radar and commu- nications equipment. After the war, Terman returned to his alma mater of Stanford to become the dean of engineering. Taking a page from Bush’s book,\\n\\nIn 1972, the Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana coined a specific type of cybernetics called “autopoiesis.” Maturana was fascinated with frogs’ eyes. A frog’s eyes sit on top of its body, giving it an almost 360° field of vision. This lets them spot potential predators as well as prey in the water, on land, or in the sky. What fascinated Maturana was a frog’s feedback loops. Its brain recognizes food only when it’s small and fast-moving, like flies. If you sat a frog in front of a pile of paralyzed flies, the frog would starve to death; its brain reacts only to quick movement. If you dangled a worm in front of a frog, the frog would starve to death; the worm wasn’t moving like a worm should. The scientists constructed little flies out of cardboard. Slurp. The frogs ate them right up. Imagine something as tiny as a fly buzzing around your head. If you’re like me, you’re always too slow to swat it, especially when it’s moving in the air. So how does a frog sitting on a lily pad successfully spit out its tongue to capture a fly in midair? Its brain does the incredible calculations to shoot its tongue to where the fly will be before it ever gets there. Skeet shooters do this, but the clay plate moves in a smooth line. Flies, on the other hand, have erratic flight patterns. What Maturana discovered is that a frog’s brain is constantly computing and autocorrect- ing at lightning speed. Its tongue isn’t like a bullet so much as it’s like a self-guided missile, constantly course-correcting as it hones in on its prey.Who knew frogs were so cool?\\n\\n† Meadows authored the seminal work The Limits to Growth revealing how an exploding human population with finite resources was destined to fail without a serious rethinking of how we live today. Senge would later become famous for his idea and subsequent book The Fifth Discipline\\n\\nCHAPTER 8: CLASSIFIED\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200971\\n\\nhe realized the value of defense research and moved to establish a radio lab at Stanford in 1945. He mentored William Hewlett and David Packard, the even- tual founders of Hewlett-Packard. If that weren’t enough, when he heard that William Shockley had founded a semiconductor company, he convinced him to set up shop near Stanford, where Shockley could find a steady stream of new graduates as eager employees. In 1951, Terman convinced the university to lease some of its land to tech companies. Stanford Research Park came to be home to Hewlett-Packard, Eastman Kodak, and divisions of GE and Lockheed.\\n\\nAnd that’s how we got Silicon Valley. Vannevar Bush’s legacy goes even further. In 1945, a young sailor found himself on the Philippine island of Leyte. The war had ended just as his ship had left its US port, so he would never see any action. Bored, he rifled through the magazines in a Red Cross hut on stilts stretching out over the water. He came across an issue of LIFE magazine and began flipping through its pages, stop- ping to read an article titled “As We May Think” by none other than Bush. In his writing, Bush predicted the creation of an office machine called the Memex that would store records, notes, and other information. What he described was essentially a desktop computer built into a regular desk.\\n\\nThe article fired up the sailor’s imagination. Twenty years later, his research would lay the groundwork, according to Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, “for everything we have in the way computers work today.”7 Many credit the sail- or-turned-researcher—one Douglas Engelbart—as the inventor of the mouse, the precursor to graphic user interface (the way we interact with computers today), and even email. Perhaps most importantly, he was one of the archi- tects who enabled computers to communicate with each other. So, he basically invented desktop computing and the internet we know today.\\n\\nNo wonder Ed’s methods work so well in digital technology: Ed and Sili- con Valley share the intellectual ancestor Dr. Ludwig von von Bertalanffy. Ed worked side by side with Captain Leslie Simon. Were it not for Simon, it might have been many more years before we had the first digital computer. And who knows how the change in that chain of events would have rippled throughout history?\\n\\nEd understood that the world was composed of systems. He intuitively thought in systems, even if he didn’t realize it. Von Bertalanffy and his disciples solidified Ed’s ideas. The cybernetics experts’ ideas of feedback loops meshed perfectly with the Shewhart Cycle, as the Cycle was essentially one endless feedback loop.\\n\\nBut Ed didn’t just learn at Aberdeen Proving Ground. He directly contrib-\\n\\nuted to the war effort in yet another strategic way.\\n\\nPART II: APPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200972\\n\\nMilitary-Grade Manufacturing\\n\\nEd’s classified work at Aberdeen revolved around using, developing, and teach- ing sampling techniques to test war munitions. Bombs, missiles, ammunition, rifles, and every other kind of armament had to fall within established tol- erance limits. If not, the lot was rejected and sent back to the manufacturer. Since 100% sampling wasn’t feasible, Ed and Captain Leslie Simon did some- thing similar to what Ed had done with the punch card operators in the Census Bureau. They recognized that variation was inevitable and, thus, sampled a fraction of each manufacturer’s output. Then they focused their quality efforts on those whose bombs or bullets fell outside of acceptable control limits.\\n\\nAt Aberdeen, Deming saw firsthand the power of this myriad of com- panies, suppliers, manufacturers, engineers, scientists, and others working together toward the national effort. They were not working as competitors and independent entities but as one massive economic ecosystem. It wasn’t every man for himself; it was one for all and all for one. Deming author Mary Walton* would later observe that the systems-thinking approach to manufacturing Ed learned at the military testing site would ironically form the heart of his later message to the Japanese.8 Ironically, this was because these were the very same lessons that, in part, helped defeat them in the first place.\\n\\nEd’s contribution to the war effort also included standardizing military procurement. The foreword from a book on control chart standards tells the tale:\\n\\nUpon request by the War Department, the American Standards Asso- ciation, in December 1940, initiated a project on the application of statistical methods to the quality control of materials and manufactured products.\\n\\nSince, due the national emergency, there was an urgent need for the prompt development of standards in this field, the ASA Defense Emer- gency Procedure (later called the War Emergency Procedure) was applied to this project, and the following Emergency Technical Committee (later, War Committee) was appointed to develop such standards:\\n\\nH.

Edwards Deming, Bureau of the Census • Leslie E. Simon, Ordnance Department, US Army • R. E. Wareham, General Electric Company • John Gaillard, American Standards Association, Secretary9\\n\\nThe committee created the Z1.1, Z1.2, and Z1.3 standards for statistical sampling methods in production. These standards, classified as secret, would be adopted as MIL-STD-105—the military standard for “Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Attributes.” In short, if you wanted to sell anything to the armed forces, from bombers to Band-Aids to M&Ms to MREs, you had to follow these rules. That included production at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Alameda Naval Air Station. These standards were the direct result of Deming’s prior work regarding the Theory of Variation and specifically the influence of Shewhart’s statistical process control.\\n\\nThe result? One Japanese economist “had known since 1941”—even before the attack on Pearl Harbor—“that Japan’s industrial production was declining every year, and thus had understood long before almost anyone else in the country that defeat was inevitable.”10\\n\\nAnother telling quote from David Halberstam’s book The Reckoning:\\n\\nThe Japanese had been aware of the low level of their [manufacturing] quality, both before the war, when Japanese goods were mocked for their shabbiness, an international joke, and even more by the middle of the war, when Japanese engineers saw American military machinery con- sistently outperform their own. Japan’s engineers had understood long before its military the vast American superiority in engineering and manufacturing, and above all in mass production. When an American plane was captured, it would be brought back to Japanese engineers to study, and by 1942 those engineers knew the vastness of the techno- logical gap. As they examined captured material they were sickeningly aware that the Americans were turning out better-made machines— yet machines that were obviously mass-produced—and that Japanese pilots were being sent into the skies hopelessly mismatched. (emphasis added)11\\n\\nSpeaking of pilots, after the war a Japanese researcher recollected, “Every Japanese will remember the fact that during the war our industry pro- duced innumerable planes which couldn’t keep aloft long enough to meet any enemy plane to fight with.

He also directly impacted virtually every factory and manufacturer involved in the war effort via these military standards based on the theories of knowledge and variation. His experience at Aberdeen bathed him in an appre- ciation of systems thinking. He witnessed how companies setting aside the Western impulse to compete with each other and instead simply focus on con- tinuous improvement led to a cooperative national effort—that they shouldn’t focus on competition but simply strive to be better tomorrow than they were yesterday.\\n\\nOn multiple fronts, Ed—armed with his budding discovery of the tenets of Profound Knowledge—played no small part in the main reason the Allies won World War II.\\n\\nCHAPTER 8: CLASSIFIED\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200975\\n\\nPart III\\n\\nInternational Implications of Profound Knowledge\\n\\nAfter the war was over, Deming had the opportunity to take\\n\\nhis ideas abroad, finding a second home in the nation of Japan.\\n\\nHis experiences there would not only crystalize the tenets of\\n\\nProfound Knowledge but would also influence him as much as\\n\\nhe influenced those around him. Eventually, he would have the\\n\\nchance to bring his methods back to his homeland.\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\nSamurai Statistics\\n\\nI stayed in Japan for two months to assist with studies of nutrition, agricul- tural production, housing, fisheries, etc. In that way I became friends with and learned from some of the great Japanese statisticians.* Statistics was well established in Japan.\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming\\n\\nPeople say that Dr. Deming taught the Japanese, but truth be told, he learned just as much from them. It’s important to understand the Japanese culture, its resilience, and the devastation the country was in when Deming arrived. His experiences there would lead him to the critical insights that put the finishing touch on his System of Profound Knowledge.\\n\\nTsunami Nation\\n\\nIt was Mr. Jujiro Matsuda’s seventy-fifth birthday. He didn’t take the day off. Quite the opposite. When he became CEO of a local agricultural import and produce conversion business twenty-four years earlier, he’d set an example of being a hard worker. Today would be no different.\\n\\nThe men in his family had a tradition: On your birthday, you got a haircut. So, the elder executive arrived at his favorite barbershop early. He wanted to be the first person in the barber’s chair so he could quickly get to the office.\\n\\nThe barber unlocked the door at 7:30. As the CEO began to make his way there, he saw another man who’d apparently had the same idea: first in, first out. Despite his seventy years, Matsuda sprinted for the door. His competitor did the same. The executive made it a split second sooner, just managing to get his shoe in the door before the other. He’d won—not only the race but the precious half-hour he would’ve endured waiting for the other patron.\\n\\nBy 8:00, he’d paid the barber and hopped in his car. His chauffeur put the Pacific Coast on their right, the distant inland mountains on the left, and sped down the coast. Because of a small rise, it wasn’t a straight shot to his\\n\\nThe earliest Japanese statisticians in the Meiji Restoration were upper-caste samurai, Japan’s\\n\\nfirst warrior-statisticians.\\n\\nworkplace; the highway slightly detoured around it. At sixteen minutes after eight—the second guy would have been about halfway through his haircut— the executive’s car approached the factory.\\n\\nHe had reason to be proud of what he saw. Raised as the son of a hum- ble fisherman, he’d founded his own startup before becoming CEO the year after the import company’s insolvency. Since taking the reins, he’d dropped the import business and transformed the produce-conversion operations into a machine-tool manufacturer. He’d then diversified the company into manu- facturing motorized trikes, but that market paled in comparison to a defense contract he’d landed just a few years before.\\n\\nTwo seconds later, world history was made . . . a mere fifty yards from the barbershop he’d just left. And he missed it. We can pinpoint the moment between the era when he entered his car and the era when he crawled away from it: August 6, 1945, at 8:16:02.\\n\\nHiroshima. The blast radius vaporized everything within a mile. It caused fires and further devastation up to 4.4 miles away. Matsuda and his driver had escaped instant death by a literal toehold. Despite being less than five hundred feet tall, Mount Hijiyama, the “small rise,” saved the two men, as well as the Toyo Kogyo factory, from the brunt of the explosion.\\n\\nAs one of the few industrial buildings left standing after the blast, it quickly became the headquarters of the recovery efforts, serving as a makeshift hospital, the local prefect’s government offices, housing for survivors, and broadcasting site for the NHK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation. In addition to hosting these groups, the factory went back into production mere days later, manufac- turing their three-wheeled . . . well, they’re called a “three-wheeled open truck,” but they look like trikes with truck beds.*\\n\\nMatsuda would go on to become one of the city’s greatest philanthropists. Toyo Kogyo would go on to become Hiroshima’s largest employer and the economic engine of its rebirth. A year before Deming’s NBC special aired, the corporation sold a quarter of its equity to Ford Motor Company. The executives at that time thought it was a good idea to update the company’s name too. The choice was obvious: the brand that they had already been selling automobiles under for the past forty-eight years . . . which itself was a derivative of what they’d first named their truck-trikes.\\n\\nThe Mazda-Go. Yes, that Mazda.\\n\\nI guess it’s like a Chevrolet El Camino: nobody really knows what the hybrid mutant is sup-\\n\\nposed to be.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200980\\n\\nSome have referred to the Japanese as having a tsunami culture. Sitting on the edge of the Pacific, Philippine, and Eurasian tectonic plates, large-scale disasters caused by earthquakes and tsunamis were simply a fact of life. This might partly explain how quickly the Japanese people began recovery efforts, both in the immediate aftermath and the long-term.\\n\\nAs Friedrich Nietzsche said, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”\\n\\nAshes to Occupation\\n\\nBy the time the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, it had become the first non-Western “great power” and one of the most industrialized nations on Earth. By the time the US bombed Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, Japan had been reduced to a developing country. Much of its infrastructure, telephone and elec- trical grids, industries, financial markets, and economy had been devastated. Because of the Allies’ successful aerial and naval blockades, Japan was starved for resources—quite literally. In fact, the nation would teeter on the edge of starvation for the next several years. Some 80% of all factory and pro- duction sites had been decimated from bombing runs; manufacturing was a tenth of what it’d been before the war.1 Imagine logging into Amazon and 80% of every listing had those dreaded red words “OUT OF STOCK.” Now, imagine an entire country like that. Also, you’re starving.\\n\\nThe military had little fuel left. Most of its ships sat in ports, ready to defend a city but not attack the enemy. Few aircraft flew; the Allies had carte blanche to bomb the islands. And they did.\\n\\nHiroshima was devastating, but tragically, even the scale of Enola Gay’s pay- load was only a fraction of the nation’s devastation. A firebombing raid on Tokyo on March 9, 1945, killed an estimated one hundred thousand people—roughly as many as the first atomic bomb.2 Some 129,000 to upward of a quarter-million more died at Nagasaki. By the time of Mr. Matsuda’s haircut, every major city had already been firebombed. Only the old capital of Kyoto had been somehow spared. Train stations. Telephone relays. City water systems. All was rubble.\\n\\nThe nation’s industrial base was in ruin; agriculture production was off by a third. The once-prosperous populace had gone first without con- sumer goods, then without food for the wartime effort. Now there was little of either.\\n\\n. . . Practically all of the area of heavy industry between Tokyo and Yokohama and in every big city [was] a complete blank, some concrete and twisted steel left. . . . Food was scarce. A tearoom in those days . . . was exactly that—no more than tea was served. Rice . . . could not be served\\n\\nCHAPTER 9: SAMURAI STATISTICS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200981\\n\\nin restaurants. People were forbidden to sleep in the Tokyo train station because so many had died—not from cold, but from hunger.3\\n\\nA Washington Post article said, “Economic planners thought it would be a\\n\\nmiracle if the pre-war standard of living could be restored.”4\\n\\nWhen Emperor Hirohito broadcast Japan’s unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945, over five hundred military officers committed suicide, many of them by ritualistic seppuku. Elsewhere, it was welcome news that would spark worldwide celebration. This was when a photographer snapped the iconic shot of a US sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square—the only picture that today could rival Rosie the Riveter as one of the most recognizable images of World War II. So how could a country recover from such devastation? An advantage was that the Japanese had strong engineers well versed in statistics and that they were built around a tsunami culture of quickly rebuilding.\\n\\nA Rich History of Statistics\\n\\nThe Allies had Rosie, Deming, and military-grade statistical process control as their secret weapons, the edge that won them the war, . . . but Japan could have had that too. In fact, prior to the war, Japan had a rich history of statistics stretching back to the 1870s.5 Japan had a strict isolationist stance: no foreign- ers in or out. The one exception were the Dutch.\\n\\nToward the end of the shōgunate era (the mid-1800s), some books on sta- tistics made their way into the country. The Japanese Statistical Society states, “Early researchers learned ideas through several books imported from Hol- land.”6 One “lower-level official” in the government named Koji Sugi seized on the ideas and worked to incorporate an official statistical system. His high- er-ups apparently took notice. By 1881, a number of national offices and ministries had created statistics departments. After a few false starts, the Meiji government conducted the first national census in 1920 and then every five years thereafter.7\\n\\nShewhart introduced control charts (a visual depiction of statistical process control) at Bell Labs in 1924. That same year, Japanese mathematician Ogura Kinnosuke “suggested the possibility of the application of statistical methods to the production process.”8 I’m unsure of whether one was influenced by the other. I suspect the credit goes to Shewhart because by 1929, Drs. Kobayashi and Nishibori had a Shewhart paper. Regarding quality control,* they had “tried to make it a go—learning by doing—but did not have great success.”9\\n\\nBy this time, many people no longer used the term statistical process control but the broader\\n\\nterm quality control (QC).\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200982\\n\\nDuring the 1930s, Japan mirrored Germany in the rise of nationalist feelings and greater militarization, eventually resulting in the 1940s surprise attacks not only at Pearl Harbor but Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. Also, by the 1940s, the nationalist “government in the war considered sta- tistics as unnecessary and non-urgent business”10 and more or less gutted statistics in Japan.\\n\\nHere’s the irony. The US used statistics to win the war, even as Japan threw statistics out the window. Afterward, Japan used statistics to win the economic war, even as the US threw statistics out the window.\\n\\nRadio Silence from Supreme Command\\n\\nOn August 30, 1945, Virginia Moriarty’s handiwork from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the USS Missouri, sailed into Tokyo Bay. Three days later, General Doug- las MacArthur (or perhaps I should write “Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers,” as President Truman had already named him) formally accepted Japan’s surrender aboard the “Mighty Mo.”\\n\\nMacArthur was perhaps one of the few historical examples we have of a benevolent dictator. Although he ostensibly answered to an international committee of the Allied Powers, “Supreme Commander” pretty much summed up his authority. According to one person on staff at MacArthur’s command (General Headquarters or simply GHQ, as it was known), the American gen- eral issued a series of edicts. The first of these were:\\n\\nJapan’s military forces would be dissolved. • The zaibatsu, the industrial cartels (essentially controlling the econ- omy) that had supported the military’s war adventures, would be abolished. Their executive managers would be removed from posi- tions of influence.\\n\\nOther proclamations addressed these subjects:\\n\\nWorkers would be free to form and join labor unions.* • Women would have the same legal status as men.† • Democratic forms of education would be established. Elementary\\n\\nschool education would be compulsory.\\n\\nThis was somewhat ironic, seeing as how millions of workers were unemployed, with zero\\n\\nprospects, because their country had been bombed to hell.\\n\\n† For contrast, in the US, a bank could refuse to issue a credit card to an unmarried woman up\\n\\nuntil 1974.\\n\\nCHAPTER 9: SAMURAI STATISTICS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200983\\n\\nChild labor would be banned. • Political prisoners would be released from jail. The secret police* would\\n\\nbe abolished.\\n\\nFreedom of religion, thought,† and political expression would be the\\n\\nright of all people.11\\n\\nWhile MacArthur allowed the existing Meiji constitutional government to continue and for Emperor Hirohito to remain on the throne, he replaced the entire cabinet. Unfortunately, it took forever for the few people within the sound of MacArthur’s voice to get the word out.\\n\\nThe problem with MacArthur’s edicts was that they couldn’t be commu- nicated. As one American would recount, “ there were no widely circulated newspapers. The telephone system was not working. It was difficult to travel around the country. There was no radio broadcast system.”12\\n\\nIt didn’t matter what the Supreme Commander said if no one outside the room could hear it. And according to that same staffer, these were just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.\\n\\nWhat was needed was a dependable source of supply of equipment, . . . But, the companies that had produced these products previously were . . . out of business. Their factories had been destroyed. Their work- ers had been drafted into military service or had otherwise disappeared. Machine tools and production equipment had been lost or had been deployed out to the countryside to escape air-raid damage. An entire class of senior managers had been dismissed in the zaibatsu purges.13\\n\\nCue Homer Sarasohn. There’s a controversy in some circles about who deserves the most credit for introducing statistical process control to Japan. Some historians point to Sarasohn and his efforts via the Civil Communication Section (CCS) in Japan. In April of 1946, eight months after Emperor Hirohito’s radio broadcast to the few people who could hear it, the American electrical engineer arrived to head the CCS in the Occupied Japan version of the “green zone” around MacArthur’s headquarters. Charles Protzman from Hawthorne Works and Frank Polking- horn from Bell Labs would soon join him.\\n\\nOfficially, the Special Higher Police; apparently Japan’s counterpart to the German Gestapo. The security agency had imprisoned thousands of suspected leftists and political prisoners since the 1920s.\\n\\n† The Special Higher Police was also known as the Thought Police. You can’t make this stuff up.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200984\\n\\nOne of the first things the CCS did was place an order for vacuum tubes (radios still used them in those days) with Toshiba. When Sarasohn asked to see a statistical process control chart from the manufacturer to assess qual- ity, Dr. Nishibori and his colleagues didn’t understand, which was puzzling, seeing as how control charts had been used at Toshiba as early as 1931;14 apparently, something got lost in translation. The CCS folks were aghast. “You don’t know a control chart?” they shouted. “How do you plan to manage quality?”15\\n\\nIn 1964, the Mainichi—Daily News of Tokyo wrote, “The concept of quality control made inroads into the Japanese industries in the form of an Occupa- tion Forces order to communication equipment manufacturers.”16 Not true: CCS may have stoked the fire, but, as we’ve already seen, the fire had started years before with sparks from Shewhart’s statistical process control. And, as we’ll soon see, the flames were fanned by Ed.\\n\\nBeknownst or unbeknownst to them, the Japanese government newly installed by MacArthur already had their eye on statistics before Sarasohn arrived. The new leaders made reestablishing Japan’s statistical institutions a priority and by May 1946 had created a cabinet-level ad hoc commission on how to go about that. Shortly after Christmas, the government established what would eventually become the Statistics Bureau.\\n\\nAnd the Statistics Bureau needed help counting rice.\\n\\nRice Statistics\\n\\nThe GHQ sent a letter to the US War Department calling for a team of crack economists. They responded by sending Rice.\\n\\nIt’s a strange case of unintended irony: the Rice Statistics Mission heavily revolved around Japanese rice production, but its name came from the head of the mission, Dr. Stuart A. Rice, who served as the Assistant Director of the US Bureau of the Budget.17 Rice, in turn, recruited six other people. As a former assistant director at the US Census, he must have been familiar with Ed.\\n\\nEd was in India to assist with the newly independent country’s census. Before leaving for Greece earlier that year, he’d left Uncle Sam’s employ and hung out his own shingle as a “Consultant in Statistical Studies,” a title he’d hold for the rest of his life. While in India in December, he was asked to travel to Tokyo to join the Rice Statistics Mission. The nation still faced starvation; little progress had been made since GHQ had set up command over a year before.\\n\\nThe next month, January of 1947, Ed arrived in Japan. The Rice Statistics Mission operated under the purview of GHQ’s Economic and Scientific Sec-\\n\\nCHAPTER 9: SAMURAI STATISTICS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200985\\n\\ntion, or ESS. He immediately began working with his counterparts in Japan’s Statistics Bureau. MacArthur needed to get a handle on food production, the food shortage, the housing shortage, and other basic levels of Maslow’s hier- archy of needs. Ed, being one of the foremost experts in the world on census statistical sampling, also helped them prep for an overdue nationwide census. (The military government had foregone the 1945 census.) Talk about déjà vu: “The cabinet-level statisticians resisted the new idea of sampling and opted for an old-fashioned 100% survey.”18 I imagine Ed dredged up his stories from just eight years earlier at the US Census about this very topic.\\n\\nBefore he left, Deming was made the first honorary member of the Japa- nese Statistical Society, a testament to his contributions and collegial spirit.19\\n\\nA Man on a Mission\\n\\nFor the first two years during Occupied Japan, US policy wasn’t keen on rebuild- ing the Asian nation. Quite the opposite: MacArthur had to fight Washington. The politicians back home wanted their former foe to pay for what they’d done. Literally.\\n\\nAfter World War I, the Allies forced Germany to make serious financial reparations for the Great War. This considerably slowed Germany’s economic recovery. That plus the worldwide Great Depression are often pointed to as contributors to German discontent and the rise of Hitler.\\n\\nMacArthur did not want a repeat of history. It would take two full years for Washington to reverse US policy and get serious about rebuilding Japan. Not out of a sense of benevolence, mind you, but to establish an Eastern bulwark against the rising threat of Russia.\\n\\nWhen Ed arrived sixteen months after surrender, little had been accom-\\n\\nplished. And by little, I mean nearly nothing.\\n\\nFew people understand the reality of life in a war-torn country. Few people want to understand it. Not Ed—he wanted to see it. Wanting to experience Japan firsthand, he defied GHQ’s standing orders that Allied personnel were to remain inside the green zone. “While many of his American colleagues looked with disdain on their former enemies and kept to their American enclaves, Deming went wherever he could. He toured both the cities and the countryside and even sneaked off to the Kabuki theater, which at the time was off limits to Allied personnel.”20 I imagine after traveling to Greece and India beforehand, there was no way he was going to let slip this opportunity to explore a whole new world. Or what was left of it, anyway.\\n\\nHe ventured into the desperate day-to-day reality of so many Japanese— or, more specifically, the night-to-night. One US official stationed in Nagoya,\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200986\\n\\na Captain Aldon, offered to take him on a midnight visit through the empty railway yards. Dozens upon dozens of people left homeless after the war were laid out on rice mats. These were the ones who had been forbidden to sleep in the Tokyo train station because so many had died from hunger. In a warehouse near the train station, an old man and a little boy “huddled around a charcoal burner, scarcely a spark left.”21 I can’t help but wonder if, for a moment per- haps, Deming saw two little boys and their mother huddled around a candle in a tarpaper shack, praying for food.\\n\\nThe Professor was more than moved: he was moved to action. He began purchasing food from the military PX (post exchange) and carrying it around with him to pass out to the starving and destitute. When he toured an asylum, he found the patients neglected, malnourished, and abused. Ed did everything in his power to have the superintendent fired and replaced. When he crossed a canal to find a father with a little boy and girl in rags begging, he hurried back to the green zone to purchase a dozen doughnuts for them that very night.22\\n\\nThese encounters, I believe, are a crucial reason why Ed would come to adopt Japan as a home away from home. He found something in the land of the rising sun he apparently hadn’t in his travels to India, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, and wher- ever else his work had taken him. For the rest of life, whenever he traveled to Japan, he never accepted any money from the Japanese. He donated to the peo- ple of Japan all the fees from his lectures—and he would make over two dozen visits over the next thirty years—as well as the not-insubstantial royalties of his translated books.23 Years later, when Japanese executives would come to sit at his proverbial feet, he never charged them consulting fees.24 That’s right: for all of his work, time, energy, effort, and influence in Japan, Ed never profited a dime. He would become a man on a mission, but he didn’t act like a missionary coming to save the natives from themselves. Ed genuinely appreciated Japan. He admired Japanese gardens (he had quite a green thumb himself), loved the notoriously difficult-to-comprehend Noh plays, attended Kabuki theatre every chance he had, visited temples and shrines, and absolutely loved the food. Ed even tried his hand at Japanese flower arranging. He once wrote, “My method of learning is to become, so far as possible, Japanese.”25\\n\\nWell, he would get the chance to fall in love with the food. During the Rice Mission of 1947, there wasn’t much Japanese fare to be had. On the contrary, people were starving. His counterparts in the Japanese Statistics Bureau faced the same hardships everyone else in the country did. Because of this, Deming would regularly invite his colleagues to come back to his hotel for dinner. He would arrange a small, private room and then pack it with whatever he could pick up from the PX: “such delicacies as rolls and butter, canned pork and beans, and cake and ice cream.”26\\n\\nCHAPTER 9: SAMURAI STATISTICS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200987\\n\\nOne of these colleagues, Dr. Yamauchi Jiro at University Tokyo, would go on to recommend Deming’s book Statistical Adjustment of Data to a Professor Sigeiti Moriguti. Moriguti immediately began translating it and would later even correspond with Deming on its content and finer points. Such were the enduring relationships Ed made and nurtured in the land of the rising sun.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the Rice Mission, the Japanese Prime Minister threw a reception in Rice’s honor, inviting members of the Statistics Bureau. Between Deming’s daily work with his counterparts and the reception, he came to be quite familiar with the Japanese statistician community. As was the story of the Professor’s life, they wouldn’t appreciate the opportunity they had in front of them until after he left.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200988\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nJUSE & the Gentle Giant\\n\\nThere was this kid I grew up with; he was younger than me. . . . Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for GIs on the way to the West Coast. That kid’s name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man, a man of vision and guts. And there isn’t even a plaque, or a signpost, or a statue of him in that town!\\n\\n—Hyman Roth, The Godfather: Part II\\n\\nHow does one go about rebuilding an entire economy from the ground up? How do you go from a war zone to the Japanese Economic Miracle? How does “Made in Japan” go from being a joke to spawning juggernauts? If we had to fer- ret out the primary catalyst of this transformation, what one entity would we choose? Homer Sarasohn would probably point to the Civil Communications Section while he was at the helm. Others point to the Training Within Industry (TWI) program that the US sponsored. Many look to Dr. Joseph Juran.* Plenty have given Deming the credit.\\n\\nAll would be misled. One of the linchpins of the restoration and eventual domination of the nation’s economy was not a foreigner. Japan’s economic miracle came about in large part because of a humble forty-two-year-old Japa- nese man living in Tokyo, a German literature college dropout who’d picked up statistics somewhere along the way. This quiet soul masterminded the resur- gence of what would become one of Japan’s most influential organizations in the industrial rebuilding effort after the war. Without his clever wordplay, the organization wouldn’t have been approved by GHQ or accepted by the Japa- nese business community. Without his establishing a strategic relationship with Deming, the Professor wouldn’t have made the connections necessary to influence the vast majority of the nation’s industrial capital. In short, without this man, Japan’s postwar recovery would look very different than it did.\\n\\nHe was once in charge of chauffeuring Walter Shewhart around Hawthorne Works and had this impression of him: “[He] exhibited flashes of brilliance, but was mainly impractical and unintelligible. He had never been in a factory before and with respect to his understanding of factory operations his ignorance was complete.”\\n\\nThe Curious Case of Ken’ichi Koyanagi\\n\\nWalter Shewhart preferred to operate behind the scenes. It was he who master- minded the War Committee, which resulted in Ed and Bell Labs’ Harold Dodge, among others, creating the military standards used during World War II. He never seemed to be in the spotlight, preferring, like the Wizard of Oz, to be the man behind the curtain.\\n\\nIf Shewhart had a Japanese mirror image, it would have to be Ken’ichi Koyanagi. You could always find the man at the fringes of great stories and initiatives happening around Japan. But for all his influence, you could never find him at the center of anything . . . including his own life.\\n\\nWhen I realized the importance of Koyanagi’s influence, I immediately tried to learn more about him. I hit a brick wall at every turn. I even hired a graduate student who was a native Japanese speaker to pore through docu- ments not yet translated for any information on the man. When I contacted the organization he founded, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE), asking about one of their founding members and longest-serving man- aging directors, they regretted they had scant information on his life before the founding of the organization. They knew his date of birth and that he’d “dropped out from Waseda University in 1928.”1 That’s the sum total of his life before becoming the director of a research institute during the war in 1940. The first thirty-seven years of his life are a blank slate, which I find odd—sus- picious, even.\\n\\nDeming’s accounts list two clues: (1) that Koyanagi majored in German literature; (2) that he was imprisoned for eight years. Deming suspected the imprisonment was politically motivated, because when his Japanese colleague applied for a visa to visit the US, Koyanagi had no trouble being approved.\\n\\nBy 1940, he’d landed a role as the director of the Nikkeisha Industry Research Institute. In 1941, he became the technical research director of the Kosei-kai* and then of the Greater Japanese Technological Association, the pre- decessors of JUSE.\\n\\nBy the end of the war, however, Koyanagi and his colleagues were among the tens of thousands of skilled professionals who found themselves unem- ployed and, for some, unemployable after the war—unemployable because MacArthur’s GHQ forbid upper-caste scientists and such who’d been part of the war production effort to ever work in similar positions again, especially if they’d been part of the zaibatsu cartels. For instance, it’s telling that an anno-\\n\\nVariously translated or referred to as the “Industrial Policy Association” or the “Association for\\n\\nthe Promotion of Industrial Problems”; founded by Okochi Masatoshi in 1918.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200990\\n\\ntated bibliography of the prominent professor Karou Ishikawa (famous for his fishbone diagram) leaves a blank space for all of 1946.2\\n\\nAt the time of the surrender, “ millions of industrious people . . . had been thrown out of work, and tens of thousands of talented scientists and engineers were almost completely at a loss about what to do.”3 Some of these would be the same scientists and engineers I mentioned in the last chapter who were sickened at the high quality of mass-manufactured US planes pulled from the ocean.\\n\\nOne challenge was that GHQ had dismantled and/or dissolved several organizations. This was the plight of Ishikawa and others like him, including Eizaburo Nishibori (who’d tried to implement Shewhart’s statistical process control). As Deming said in Out of the Crisis,“Japanese military authorities formed for the War effort several groups of scientists. One group was under the leadership of Kenichi Koyanagi. He held his group together after the War with a new aim, the reconstruction of Japan.”4\\n\\nDuring the war, Koyanagi had been the research director of Kosei-kai. In 1944, the Kosei-kai merged with two other war-related research groups to become the Dai-Nihon Gijutsu-kai, the Greater Japanese Technological Asso- ciation, headed by Koyanagi.5 MacArthur’s GHQ disallowed such groups. On April 30, 1946, the Greater Japanese Technological Association was officially dissolved. MacArthur did, however, support unionization. On May 1, just a day after the organization’s dissolution, the GHQ approved a new one: the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers or JUSE.\\n\\nThe fact that its seven founding members* had been part of the previous\\n\\ngroup? Sheer coincidence, I’m sure.\\n\\nKoyanagi’s JUSE felt that same patriotic fervor that Naomi Parker and Virginia Moriarty had: their country cried out for help, and they decided to answer the call. Instead of a military war, though, JUSE faced an economic war. Not against another economic power but against starvation, decimation, and death. “Night after night, they would meet to talk. . . . But they had little idea of how to begin the task they had assigned themselves.”6 They sat around eat- ing rice and drinking sake, as it was all they had.\\n\\nAs is often the case during economically devastated times, a barter system quickly arose as well as a black market. In fact, the black market was what kept JUSE together in 1946. Nishibori kept his job of being in charge of lightbulb production at Toshiba. He would smuggle lightbulbs from the factory and then ride his bicycle into the countryside, his pockets bulging with bulbs, to trade\\n\\nKen’ichi Koyonagi, Eizaburo Nishibori, Eizo Watanabe, Shin Miura, Shigeru Mizuno, Masao\\n\\nGotō, and Masao Kogure.\\n\\nCHAPTER 10: JUSE & THE GENTLE GIANT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200991\\n\\nthe scarce commodity to farmers for rice and sake. He’d bring back his trades to the JUSE meeting rooms, the Tokyo Engineers’ Club in the Osaka Shōsen building near Tokyo Central Station. Each night, they’d eat rice, drink sake, and discuss how to rebuild their world.\\n\\nThis is where Koyanagi’s political savvy begins to show. As I mentioned earlier, Koyanagi dissolved one organization on the last day of April, then submitted papers for a “union” on the first of May. By design, however, the translation was obfuscated. In English, the organization was called the “Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers.” In Japanese, however, the word “union” was purposely left off. Instead, it was the Federation of Japanese Scientists and Engineers. Thus, its very name was palatable to the Americans (“Hey, look, a workers union!”) as well as to Japanese businessmen (who frowned on workers’ unions and who might still stigmatize the communists after the war).\\n\\nOnce JUSE was formally established, Koyanagi approached Ichiro Ishi- kawa, offering him the presidency. This was an extraordinarily savvy move because Ichiro was the head of the Federation of Economic Organizations,* arguably the most powerful business entity in the country at that time. With Ichiro as the public face of the organization, JUSE was legitimized, protected, and, as such, above reproach from both GHQ and the Japanese.\\n\\nIn 1948—the year after Ed’s trip with the Rice Mission—Homer Sarasohn’s CCS group mandated the use of military quality control standards (or “QC,” what the Japanese would come to use instead of statistical process control) to man- ufacture communications equipment at the NEC plant.7 CCS began by creating their version of a QC course and summoned their manufacturing suppliers.\\n\\nThe class was so bad that “only two students attended at first, Nishibori from Toshiba and Nishio from NEC, with neither of them comprehending much of what was taught. . . . Later others joined, but a doubt lingered about the usefulness of CCS’s QC and such seminars. ‘It looks like statistics—is QC statistics?’ ”8 That’s how ineffective their course was: The two students had to put two and two together before even asking if QC was related to statistics. However, based on their prior knowledge of Shewhart’s statistical pro- cess control, they knew something was missing. There was more to this story because they’d seen some of this stuff before the war. What they were getting out of the CCS course wasn’t everything they needed. Sarasohn and company belabored the importance of results (focusing on the product) via inspection. This didn’t mesh with Shewhart’s predictive analytics approach. Nishibori finally realized what they were doing wrong. CCS’s approach was basically based\\n\\nKeidanren.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200992\\n\\non enumerative statistics, whereas Shewhart’s ideas centered around analytical statistics, focusing on improving the process.\\n\\nThe managing director of JUSE remembers Nishibori coming to the Engi- neers Club one night (to eat rice and drink sake, no doubt) and impressing upon his colleagues that QC was the secret weapon they were looking for.9 Just not CCS’s version. Shewhart’s broader concepts behind QC would be the keys to unlocking Japan’s potential. Either because he was persuasive or because the sake made his colleagues persuadable, they agreed to form a Quality Control Research Group in 1948.10 It was a noble effort for what amounted to a scaven- ger hunt. Except no one knew what was on the list.\\n\\nBut it’s amazing what you find when you start looking.\\n\\nAt a library saved from war damages, they found a copy each of such literature as the USA War Standards Z1.2 and Z1.4, Walter A. Shewhart’s Economic Control of Manufactured Product, and a little later the same author’s Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control, and E. S. Pearson’s The Application of Statistical Methods to Industrial Standardisa- tion and Quality Control and some other fragmentary bulletins. These were indeed valuable gems for us, forming a small group of scientists and engineers.11*\\n\\nNote the hand of Deming in the War Standards as well as Statistical Method\\n\\nfrom the Viewpoint of Quality Control.\\n\\nExcited at their discoveries, JUSE went to the people they thought would be thrilled with their finding: Homer Sarasohn and the CCS. This did not go well. According to Sarasohn himself,\\n\\n[I] had to put my foot down unceremoniously with Koyanagi . . . Ishi- kawa and some others of . . . JUSE. They had a simple-minded view. . . . It occurred to them that all one had to know was the mathe- matics of statistics—that was what enabled the United States to win the war!! . . . So, I blocked the JUSE effort to go wandering off on the wrong track. At the same time, I had another motive. I wanted the plant managers’ attention to be focused on the production matters at hand. I did not want their concentration diverted to abstractions they were not yet prepared to handle. It was a question of priorities, and JUSE was off-base. (emphasis added)12\\n\\nDespite those military standards being classified, the Japanese were still able to get copies of\\n\\nthem. As Deming would say of the espionage, “They had their ways.”\\n\\nCHAPTER 10: JUSE & THE GENTLE GIANT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200993\\n\\nIn other words, Koyanagi and the rest of JUSE wanted to go all-in on Shewhart’s version of QC. This meant implementing statistical process con- trol and the PDSA cycle to improve every aspect of their factories’ operations. Sarasohn, however, wanted them to focus solely on the task at hand: pro- ducing vacuum tubes without implementing the more advanced aspects of Shewhart’s ideas.\\n\\nWhat Sarasohn didn’t realize was that Koyanagi’s approach was precisely what won the war for the Allies. Koyanagi and his colleagues’ thinking was more in line with what Deming taught through the Stanford classes. (Remember, some of these engineers were the ones who saw firsthand how outclassed in quality they were from inspecting downed American planes.) Statistical process control wasn’t just about applying statistics to output. Quality touched every- thing in the process: not just the production lines and inspecting widgets, but everything, including the quality of raw materials and components received from suppliers and vendors.\\n\\nFortunately for Japan and the rest of the world, Koyanagi, Ishikawa, and the others decided to ignore Sarasohn—discreetly, I’m sure—and proceed with what they believed was best for their country. (In IT parlance, we would refer to this as “Do now. Ask forgiveness later.”) In May of 1949, Nishibori started a QC program;13 a month later, Kitagawa Toshio and Ishida Yasushi did as well.14 In September of 1949, JUSE launched its year-long QC Basic Course.\\n\\nAround the same time as JUSE’s QC course, Sarasohn gave a CCS Man- agement Seminar in Tokyo and then another in Osaka in 1950. Seeing as how his seminars, in his mind, were off to a “good start,” he then decided “the time was now ripe for the detailed course on statistical quality control that I had had in mind.”15 One researcher observed, “the CCS course was, in practice, a rather limited effort: offered just twice under American sponsorship, it directly reached only a small fraction of Japan’s managerial elite.”16\\n\\nFor the rest of his life, though, Sarasohn would believe that his two courses were the inspiration for the Japanese embracing QC, either unaware of or out- right ignoring the training JUSE and others were already providing. To this day, there’s still some debate as to Sarasohn’s legacy in Japan.\\n\\nThe one issue with JUSE’s version of QC was that it was based on the pre- war works of Shewhart. It didn’t include the much broader applications used by the Americans during the war, and especially all that Deming had learned beyond Shewhart, specifically that statistical process control could be used beyond manufacturing.\\n\\nThis would soon be rectified when the Professor began to teach. Unlike Sarasohn, he didn’t underestimate the Japanese scientists’ and engineers’ ability to understand advanced concepts of statistics. Perhaps more impor-\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200994\\n\\ntantly, Ed knew that unless it included top management, the classes were unlikely to succeed.\\n\\nWhen Professor Moriguti, who’d been in correspondence with Deming while translating Statistical Adjustment of Data, mentioned to Koyanagi that the American would soon be returning to Tokyo in 1950, Koyanagi quickly moved to capitalize on the information, inviting Ed to address JUSE.\\n\\nIn the US after the war, statistical process control had virtually disap- peared, even at AT&T where Shewhart had invented control charts. “By 1949, Dr. Deming says mournfully, ‘there was nothing—not even smoke.’ ”17 Getting an invitation to address a ready, willing, and desperate audience of hundreds was music to Ed’s ears. He readily accepted. In his reply, Ed wrote, “As for remu- neration, I shall not desire any. It will be only a great pleasure to assist you.”18\\n\\nLater, he would again refuse any compensation, directing Koyanagi to use the collected lecture fees for the benefit of JUSE. When Moriguti published the translated version of Ed’s book, the Professor refused any royalties, again directing them to be used for the benefit of the Japanese. He was well aware of the hardships the unemployed and the unemployable statisticians faced.\\n\\nKoyanagi—in another stroke of extraordinary savvy—proposed to the members of JUSE that they use the proceeds from the lecture fees and book royalties to fund a prize in Deming’s honor. It was aptly named the Deming Prize and would soon become one of the highest and most sought-after awards for quality control in the world.\\n\\nThis accomplished three critical purposes. One, it immediately associated JUSE with one of the most accomplished and famous statisticians in the world at the time. Two, in doing so, it indirectly laid a sort of territorial claim to the man: “Hey, Deming belongs to us. Hands off. Looking at you, Japanese Statis- tical Association.” Third, it all but guaranteed Deming’s continued and crucial involvement in Japan. Savvy, indeed.\\n\\nThe Prophecy at the Club\\n\\nEd made such an impression on MacArthur during the 1947 statistics mission that the following year, the Supreme Commander (or, at least, General Head- quarters) directly invited Deming to come back. He wanted to return but got caught up in a number of other projects, including his work at the UN. In 1949, he was able to arrange his second visit for the year after.\\n\\nIn a letter to his Japanese colleague Professor Moriguti, Deming men- tioned his upcoming trip to assist GHQ. Moriguti excitedly informed Koyanagi. Upon hearing this, the JUSE director wrote to Deming directly in March of\\n\\nCHAPTER 10: JUSE & THE GENTLE GIANT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200995\\n\\n1949, politely requesting two things: would he teach a short course in statistics to JUSE, and would he submit an article for the inaugural issue of Statistical Quality Control,* a journal to be published the following year?19\\n\\nEd said yes. He would later note that, to his knowledge, he was the only man as part of an occupied force who’d ever been voluntarily invited to return to the conquered country by the conquered.\\n\\nJust as Ed did in his reply letter to the economics professor in what became the Stanford classes, he replied to Koyanagi with suggestions on how to struc- ture the course. As it turned out, Ed simply dusted off his notes from the Stanford classes. It had helped the US win World War II, and he saw no reason why his principles and teachings wouldn’t work just as well in Japan.\\n\\nHe stepped off the passenger plane on June 16, 1950. Three days later, JUSE’s eight-day course—GHQ paid for the event at about $200 per person— began in the Tokyo Medical Auditorium at Tokyo University. There were 220 engineers, scientists, and statisticians. All the proceeds went straight into JUSE’s virtually empty coffers.20\\n\\nDeming also gave a public lecture on statistical sampling at the Institute of Statistics and Mathematics in Tokyo.21 Somewhere between five hundred and six hundred scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and others formed a stand- ing-room-only crowd.22 In the middle of this lecture, he was “overcome with a sense of déjà vu. He was not talking to the right people.”23\\n\\nDeming would later remark,\\n\\nThey were wonderful students, but on the first day of the lectures a hor- rible thought came to me, “Nothing will happen in Japan; it’ll be a farce unless I talk to top management.” By that time I had some idea of what top management must do. There are many duties to be performed that only the top people can do: consumer research, for example; work with vendors, just for example. I knew that I must reach top management. Otherwise it would just be another flop as it was in the states.\\n\\nI immediately talked to American friends who knew the right Japa-\\n\\nnese and before long, I was talking to Mr. Icharo† [sic] Ishikawa. . . .\\n\\nI had 3 sessions with Mr. Ishikawa; and at the end of the third ses- sion, he understood what I needed to do. He sent telegrams to . . . top level men to come to the Industry Club the next Tuesday at 5 o’clock to hear Dr. Deming.24\\n\\nHinshitsu Kanri. † Ichiro Ishikawa, son of Professor Karou Ishikawa and head of the powerful business associa-\\n\\ntion Keidanren.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200996\\n\\nEd would later find out what a stroke of luck this was. He was unaware that Ichiro Ishikawa was not only the president of JUSE but the head of the nation’s most powerful business federation, the Keidanren, and a former professor of many of the country’s foremost executives. Moriguti would point out to Deming that the people in attendance controlled 80% of the capital in Japan.25 Ishikawa’s telegrams were less an invitation than a summons: in a testament to his influ- ence and/or their respect for Ishikawa, all twenty-one executives showed up.* Deming’s one-hour presentation was less a lecture than an impassioned plea. He believed they could rebuild. Indeed, according to him, “I was, in 1950, the only man in Japan who believed that.”26 He said that if they would do what he told them, they would be an economic force again in five years.\\n\\nWhat came of his prophetic plea? “Apparently they understood. They wanted more conferences, so we had more. It was a terrifying experience for me because I was new at it. I was a technical man.”27\\n\\nThus began Deming’s 1950 summer lecture series, where he traveled to about a dozen Japanese cities, from Nagoya to Osaka to Hakata to Fukuoka.† Engineers, managers, and other personnel attended.\\n\\nHis final lecture was at the Yama-No Hotel on Mount Hakone. One attendee would later say, “Here was this tall, strange American telling us that we would be an important force in five years if we did what he said. We really didn’t believe him, but in order not to lose face, we did what we were told and it worked.”28 Recall the reality they faced. One historian noted that in the immediate postwar years, if it rained in Tokyo, ten thousand telephones might go out of order. What factories there were often had dirt floors; young apprentices had the job of spraying down the floors every morning to reduce the amount of dust in the air. And there was virtually no market for the self-admitted shoddy goods they produced. Ed must have seemed like a madman to tell them that not only could they once again become a powerful nation, but that they could be back on their feet in just five years.\\n\\nHis prophecy was wrong: they did it in four. By year five, the country had an enviable economic growth rate of 9%–10% per year. By the 1960s, Japan’s growth rate climbed even higher during the fabled Japanese economic miracle. By 1968, the country was the second-larg- est economy in the world—bigger than the UK, Italy, France, and the USSR. It would hold this distinction until 2010, when China edged it out.\\n\\nUnlike Homer Sarasohn’s first all-call that resulted in just two. † These lectures were handled entirely by JUSE—not the CCS vis the ESS, as Sarasohn seems to\\n\\nclaim in his letter to Lloyd Dobyns.\\n\\nCHAPTER 10: JUSE & THE GENTLE GIANT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200997\\n\\nYears later, Ed would come to be called “the Prophet.” He had seen what no one else could see. This was perhaps one of his greatest contributions to the people of Occupied Japan: he inspired hope, if not confidence.\\n\\nA beautiful sentiment from The Reckoning:\\n\\nArriving at a difficult time for the Japanese, Deming never condescended to them. He looked at them, and, unlike so many of his fellow citizens, he saw not their poverty but their purpose. At a moment when Ameri- cans were powerful and rich and the Japanese weak and vulnerable, he, unlike many Americans, never made them feel inferior. On the contrary, he genuinely reassured them. If this brilliant American expert believed in them, they could begin to believe in themselves.29\\n\\nThe Mutual Admiration Society\\n\\nShortly after Deming flew home in August of 1950, Professor Moriguti finally published the translation of Ed’s book. With Deming having directed that all the royalties of the bestseller go to JUSE, by December, at Koyanagi’s behest, JUSE established the Deming Prize.\\n\\nLess than six months after departing, Ed was back again in January of 1951. In the few short months since he had left, his audience had taken his message to heart. And run with it. At a reception in his honor, he was cornered by the CEO of a cable manufacturer who proudly unrolled his statistical control charts. He had good reason to be proud: using Deming’s ideas around Profound Knowledge, he’d cut the rework of insulated cable by 90%. In another encoun- ter, Ed learned that Tanabe Pharmaceuticals had increased their output by an astounding 200%. Six months later, the London Express newspaper bore the headline: AND NOW COME JAPANESE NYLONS AND THEY ARE OF GOOD QUALITY.30\\n\\nEd noted of a camera factory, “A year ago they made 200 cameras per month; now they are making 400, and hope it will be 500 this month and here- after, with no increase in workers or hours—simply better control of quality.”31\\n\\nDemingism was not only taking root—it was working.\\n\\nDeming’s reputation as an oracle was secured. From then on the qual- ity-control movement had its own dynamic. The top people came to Deming with a desire to learn that bordered on obsession. Watching them, listening to their intense, often awkward quotations, Deming knew that he was taking on an odd kind of permanence, that every single thing he said was being not so much memorized as codified.32\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200998\\n\\nWith every visit to Japan, Ed taught (and, as we’ve come to discover, learned) constantly and continually.* Eventually, “with the possible exception of Douglas MacArthur he was the most famous and revered American in Japan during the postwar years.”33\\n\\nTo honor his invaluable and kind efforts on behalf of the nation of Japan, in 1960 Deming received from the Prime Minister on behalf of Emperor Hiro- hito himself the Second Order Medal of the Sacred Treasure, the highest honor a foreigner can receive.\\n\\nAlthough he, too, deserved a medal, Koyanagi was never recognized for his invaluable service to his country. But without him, JUSE would never have come to be. Without JUSE, Japan wouldn’t have had the opportunity to have a world-class statistician and, by then, business management thinker so intricately involved in its rebuilding. Without Deming’s continued involvement, it might have taken many more years for Japan’s industries to find their footing again, much less become a global economic superpower.\\n\\nTo this day, historians and others still debate who had the biggest impact on Japan. Was it Sarasohn? Joseph Juran? The Training Within Industry pro- gram? While the complex influences of these people and entities aren’t clear cut, here are some of the more salient facts about Deming’s influence.\\n\\nIt was he who realized that statistical process control—and the greater movement toward enhanced manufacturing quality—couldn’t remain the sole purview of the scientists, engineers, and mid-level managers. The entire com- pany had to embrace the new philosophy, starting at the very top. That’s why Deming was so adamant about meeting the CEOs of Japanese companies.\\n\\nThanks to Koyanagi’s savvy and egoless leadership, the most influential business leader in the country just happened to head JUSE, one of the foremost organizations leading the way in quality thinking. Deming had to meet with Ishikawa three times before he finally convinced the man that Deming’s way of thinking was the path forward for Japan.\\n\\nBecause of Ed’s persuasiveness, he was able to get in front of 80% of the nation’s industrial capital. There, he convinced the CEOs that, to succeed, quality had to be a way of thinking embraced by everyone in the organization— starting at the top. Look at the CEO of the cable manufacturer who cornered Deming at that reception. When’s the last time you heard of a CEO being involved in the statistics of production? That’s a testament to the influence Deming had.\\n\\nLola sometimes came with him on trips and always made sure that the wives of her husband’s\\n\\ncolleagues were invited out too.\\n\\nCHAPTER 10: JUSE & THE GENTLE GIANT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u200999\\n\\nAs we shall see, Deming’s management teachings directly influenced what would become Japan’s most powerful companies, such as Toyota. Years later, one of Toyota’s presidents and chairmen would remark, “There is not a day I don’t think about what Dr. Deming meant to us. Deming is the core of our management.”34 It was these companies that came to dominate the American economy in the 1970s and 1980s. US managers began to copy their methods in the hope of surviving the economic onslaught. The manufacturing lessons they learned eventually became the foundation for the rapid advances in IT the world experienced from 2000 on, directly leading to the DevOps movement that is, in large part, responsible for this technological explosion.\\n\\nBut all of this was set in motion because of Koyanagi. And as the line in The Godfather II goes, “This was a great man, a man of vision and guts. And there isn’t even a plaque, or a signpost, or a statue of him . . . .”\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009100\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nThe Butterfly Effect\\n\\nEconomists have led us down the wrong road. They have taught us adversar- ial competition is the solution. It is not.\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming\\n\\nFor Deming, the System of Profound Knowledge was the vehicle; coopera- tion and management transformation were the destination. Ultimately, four key ideas would evolve into the four elements of Profound Knowledge: prag- matism, variation, human psychology, and systems thinking. Ed’s view of cooperation stood in stark contrast to business as usual, which emphasized competition, even within one’s own company. Throughout his life, he demon- strated how even competitors working together benefitted their respective companies and, more importantly, their customers. The scene at Aberdeen Proving Ground either inspired or enshrined this in his thinking. When he got to Japan, his message of transformation encompassed more than just compa- nies—it encompassed the country.\\n\\nBut this cooperation at the national level sometimes begins at the corpo-\\n\\nrate level.\\n\\nMurder by Proxy\\n\\nPaul O’Neill, CEO of Aluminum Company of America—Alcoa, a hundred- year-old industrial company that contributed to the war effort, as mentioned earlier—stood in front of the assembled group and confessed to murder.\\n\\nThe victim was an eighteen-year-old young man who’d been working at an aluminum plant for just three weeks. One ill-fated day, an aluminum extruder got jammed. This was normal; it happened fairly regularly. The fix was to climb over the protective barrier and move the jammed metal out of the way. Two supervisors, each of whom had over fifteen years of experience, watched him do it. Again, this was the informal but normal standard operating procedure. This time, however, when the extruder got unjammed, the attached boom immediately spun up, coming around and instantly killing the young man. His wife was six months pregnant. “I killed him,” O’Neill said.\\n\\nThe executive explained to the managers and supervisors assembled before him that safety was not a priority—it was the number one thing. Because he failed to effectively communicate that throughout the company and ensure that message came through loud and clear, he had failed to create a culture of safety first. Those supervisors with a combined thirty to forty years of expe- rience between them either implicitly or explicitly gave the eighteen-year-old permission to climb over the obvious safety barrier and fix a known, recurring problem. The CEO didn’t blame the worker. He didn’t blame the supervisors. He didn’t blame the person in charge of safety. He blamed himself.\\n\\nThis was especially tragic, considering that from the very moment he was hired as the CEO, he’d been serious about safety. Over O’Neill’s thirteen years as chief exec, Alcoa quintupled its net income and added $27 billion to its market cap . . . all while becoming one of the safest industrial companies in the world.\\n\\nHow’d he do it? In The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg wrote, he did it “by attacking one\\n\\nhabit and then watching the changes ripple through the organization.”1\\n\\nO’Neill understood that a company is a complex ecosystem. What happens in one place has a ripple effect throughout the whole system. Like Deming and Sully, O’Neill was a systems thinker. Instead of looking at an individual prob- lem (in this case, one untrained rookie ignoring safety precautions, resulting in a fatal accident), O’Neill wanted to understand the bigger questions: Why did two senior supervisors feel it was okay to watch (or direct?) the newbie to ignore the safety barrier? Why wasn’t the young man trained better in the first place? How had the CEO’s safety-first message gotten lost in translation? That’s what he meant by “I killed him.” As the chief exec, the buck stopped with him. O’Neill believed it was ultimately his responsibility to create a cooperative culture of workplace safety. He knew one of the ways to improve the company was to understand the answer to those questions.\\n\\nA deeper look into Alcoa’s story reveals that not only was it a story of coop- eration and transformation but also of exhibiting all four parts of Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge: the theory of knowledge as opportunities were identified and converted into nuggets of knowledge, variation to measure what they were learning, human psychology to understand and change the habits of the organization, and appreciating the interconnectedness of the whole system. To be fair, though, part of these lasting changes came about because of a discontented Benedictine nun. A group of sisters were appalled by the working conditions at one Alcoa plant in Mexico. Their messages to the company went ignored, including those addressed to Paul O’Neill, so they decided to buy fifty shares of stock and then filed a shareholder resolution.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009102\\n\\nWhen O’Neill discovered that Sister Susan Mika was going to the share- holder meeting, he called to berate her. In Sister Mika’s words, “He was very, very angry with me and really screaming, and very forceful with me on the phone.”2 He wanted to know if she was planning on bringing some of the work- ers with her. To his dismay, she was and she did. Once at the meeting, in what Sister Mika felt was a stalling tactic, the corporate secretary tried to keep them out of the room. The nuns’ group had to forcibly push their way in.\\n\\nThe workers were eventually allowed to share their stories. One particu- lar story told was of a worker who had gotten her leg caught in some of the machinery. After some quick medical attention, she was almost immediately rushed back out to the line so there were no lost workdays or work hours. (This is a classic case of an ongoing count of “no injuries in the last 380 days” that manufacturing sites like spout.) After the retelling of this story in the meeting, Sister Mika said you could hear a pin drop.\\n\\nAlthough O’Neill had tried to bully and intimidate Sister Mika, she, like David in the Bible, never lost her resolve. This confrontation eventually helped O’Neill change his views about the Mexican plants and broader safety issues, ultimately leading to significant changes.\\n\\nCooperation. That was the key to Alcoa’s success, as well as Ed’s true vision.\\n\\nDon’t Compete to Win\\n\\nAt Aberdeen, Ed saw firsthand what it was for an entire nation’s industrial infrastructure to set aside competition and market share to focus on a single, unified national effort. He knew what it was for business rivals to ignore each other and focus solely on improving their own operations, aiming for ever better and higher quality manufactured goods. The quality of mass-produced products was ultimately what won World War II. That victory came about from everyone focusing on the bigger picture.\\n\\nUp till now, there have been two schools of thought about Deming’s role in Japan. One believed him to be the hero who taught the Japanese about qual- ity. Obviously, that’s a bit of an overstatement as well as an oversimplification. It looks like Koyanagi, Nishibori, and others severely downplayed the preva- lence of statistics and existence of statistical process control in Japan before the occupation. I get the distinct impression that their American conquerors, like Sarasohn, wanted to take credit for introducing quality to Japan, and the Japanese, being Japanese, politely declined to correct them, even going so far as to obscure certain parts of history.\\n\\nThe other school of thought sees Deming discredited—someone in the right place at the right time with a free Japanese PR machine responsible for\\n\\nCHAPTER 11: THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009103\\n\\nhis legendary status. Truth be told, there were a number of factors that contrib- uted to the Japanese economic miracle—none of which would have amounted to anything if these seeds had not fallen on the fertile soil that was the culture and spirit of Japan.\\n\\nAs we’ve discussed, Ed didn’t bring statistics to Japan; the country had a rich history of statistics and even some forays into statistical process control long before Ed’s 1950 lectures. Despite books like Dr. Deming: The American Who Taught the Japanese About Quality, Ed wasn’t the white savior come to enlighten the natives. Quite the opposite: Ed’s thinking was influenced by the Japanese at least as much as he influenced them. His words were heard by a receptive audience. He didn’t bring quality control to the islands. As I presented earlier, JUSE had already launched its QC Basic Course in 1949, a year before Ed began teaching there.\\n\\nSo, what did he actually do? What was his role in the economic miracle? If JUSE already had QC before Ed, why did they give him so much credit? What is Deming’s real legacy? It is seeing the grander scheme and preaching cooperation instead of competition.\\n\\nEd wanted to infuse the spirit of Aberdeen into Japan. He wanted to inspire a nationwide effort. His advice wasn’t for individual companies on how to improve their businesses—his advice was on how all companies should work together to improve Japan.\\n\\nIn his final book, The New Economics, Deming wrote, “The boundary of the system . . . may be drawn around a single company, or around an industry, or as in Japan in 1950, the whole country.”3\\n\\nHe further wrote,\\n\\nThe three automotive companies in [the US] had together in 1960 a virtual monopoly. The management of the three companies spent time worrying about share of market. Where are we? How are we doing com- pared with our competitors? Better or worse than last month?\\n\\nBetter had all of them worked to expand the market, to make auto- mobiles for a huge market not then served by the American companies. At that very time two million people in this country needed automobiles at lower first cost, dependable, and cheaper to run. Japanese auto mak- ers came in and filled this market.4\\n\\nFord, GM, and Chrysler focused on getting a bigger piece of the pie. In 1950, Deming was already preaching that this was short-sighted thinking. If Japan was going to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, it wouldn’t be because of Western-style economic competition.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009104\\n\\nDeming gave Japan a fundamentally different view on how to practice cap- italism. Instead of companies competing with each other to get a bigger slice of the pie, they should cooperate together to grow the size of the pie instead. Even within companies, Western business management is based on confrontation and competition. Whose division is best? I’ve been part of companies where one team wouldn’t share some technological advance with another because of how their incentive structures were set up. Information silos and turf wars abounded.\\n\\nO’Neill inspired the whole of Alcoa to “become part of something import- ant.” Deming told the devastated remainder of Japan not to emulate the West but to work together toward a national effort.\\n\\nIt sounds like a self-help seminar, but Deming essentially told them that their competitors weren’t truly their competitors. They shouldn’t strive to be better than others but to strive to be better than themselves—that true com- petition was being better tomorrow than you were yesterday. These teachings exemplified the appreciation for systems thinking he’d acquired through his experiences, culminating at Aberdeen.\\n\\nA contributor to The New Economics wrote,\\n\\nWhat [Deming] taught in Japan did not exist in America. He did not export to Japan American methods. He taught there the principle of a system. . . . He relied on cooperation between people and between com- panies. Cooperation has always been in Japan a way of life.\\n\\nThe boundary of the system would be all of Japan, Deming taught them. Companies must work together in cooperation. As you learn, teach others. The transformation in Japan must be a prairie fire covering the whole country.5\\n\\nTrue, the East traditionally had a much more cooperative disposition than the West. Deming would later observe, “A lot of what I urged them to do came very naturally to the Japanese, though they were not doing it.”6\\n\\nBut thousands of executives, scientists, engineers, and others were heavily demoralized by their empire’s demise. As many historians have noted, it was a time when it seemed to the Japanese that they had lost their way. It was a crucial point in Japanese economic history. On one hand, there were their tra- ditions and approaches to industry . . . which apparently hadn’t helped, since they’d been soundly defeated. On the other hand, there was the industrialized West with Fordism and Taylorism . . . which apparently let the Allies win the war. (They couldn’t know that it was actually dropping explicit competition and instead working together toward a common goal that let the Allies win.) In the\\n\\nCHAPTER 11: THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009105\\n\\nmidst of them wrestling with a national existential crisis, along comes this six- foot, soft-spoken, gentle giant of a man with a genuine spirit of compassion who told them their industries could take the world by storm in just five years. More- over, he told them they could do it by continuing their traditions of personal and commercial cooperation . . . that they could take the best of their past, add some more formal training and better tools provided by Deming and others, and build an economic force to be reckoned with on a global scale.\\n\\nI think it could have gone either way: abandoning their past and copying Western capitalism or believing this lone prophet and staying true to their cus- toms. Fortunately for the people of Japan and the rest of the world, they bet on Ed.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009106\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nMade in Japan\\n\\nThere is not a day I don’t think about what Dr. Deming meant to us. Deming is the core of our management.\\n\\n—Shoichiro Toyoda, former president and chair of Toyota, and grandson of Sakichi Toyoda\\n\\nOne of the lesser understood discussions around Deming’s impact in Japan is that he learned at least as much—if not more—from the Japanese as he taught them. He came to Japan with a full understanding of the Theories of Knowl- edge and Variation and a deep appreciation for systems thinking. But it would be there in Japan that he culminated his final piece of Profound Knowledge, one that he’d begun thinking about at Hawthorne Works: a Theory of Human Psychology.\\n\\nWhen Ed began teaching American clients in the 1980s as the quality revolution got into full swing, he taught not only what he’d presented the Japanese but a beautiful fusion of Eastern and Western ideas. Some of the tools he provided were things he had learned from Japanese manufactur- ers . . . and there is no better example of understanding what he learned than the story of Toyota.\\n\\nLooms to Lexus\\n\\nWhen most people think of the great industrialists of the twentieth century, they think of names such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. Engineers and historians familiar with Japan’s industrial scene quickly think of engineer Taii- chi Ohno. But they leave an important person off their list—someone who absolutely deserves to be there: Sakichi Toyoda.\\n\\nSakichi Toyoda’s father was not only a farmer but a skilled carpenter in their little Japanese village. After attending primary school, Sakichi went into carpentry. But he wasn’t a carpenter; he was an inventor.\\n\\nDuring the 1880s, the shōgunate was giving way to the Meiji Restoration. As in virtually every instance of social upheaval, those at the bottom suffered the worst. Those of Sakichi’s village lived in abject poverty. Sakichi was about fifteen years old at the time, but he believed he could do something to help.\\n\\nHe settled on improving the hand-powered textile looms the villagers used to weave fabric. He quickly became somewhat obsessed. He spent years building, breaking, and redesigning looms.\\n\\nHe landed his first patent by the time he was twenty-four. The 1891 Toyoda wooden hand loom required only one hand to operate, and it eliminated the unevenness of the weave. Those who adopted the loom could make more fabric of higher quality in the same amount of time. Never satisfied, as true tinkerers never are, he continued to invent. Another patent was issued to him in 1894, this time for a spool-winding machine.\\n\\nBy 1896, Sakichi had invented a steam-powered loom like those used in Europe and the US. He then created a mechanism that would allow looms to run continuously without having to stop to replace empty thread spools. Over the next twenty-five years, he continued inventing as well as entering a num- ber of different business partnerships, both in textile production and loom manufacturing.\\n\\nHis crowning achievement came in 1924: the Toyoda automatic loom. Its key feature was the jidoka apparatus. Before Sakichi’s invention, if there was a problem with how the machine threaded, it wouldn’t be detected until some- one noticed it. Consequently, all the fabric it had produced in the meantime had to be scrapped. There was a lot of rework, which meant a lot of waste. The jidoka loom, on the other hand, stopped itself immediately if a needle broke. Since the loom was also self-feeding, this meant one worker could effectively run multiple looms at the same time, vastly increasing productivity. Sakichi’s looms were also safer, more reliable, and easier to handle. A British engineer from the world’s leading textile machine manufacturer admiringly dubbed it “the magic loom.”\\n\\nThe articles of incorporation for Sakichi’s new company in 1926, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, stated that a central tenet of the company “shall be pursuing related invention and research.”1 He passed away in 1930. However, his spirit was alive and well, not only in his son, Kiichirō Toyoda, but infused into the very culture of the company itself. They call it kaizen. It simply means “continuous improvement.”\\n\\nTo me, there’s also an element of an indomitable spirit that’s part and parcel of kaizen. Those years Sakichi spent building and breaking wooden hand-powered looms, motivated not by the promise of fortune but a deep desire to improve the lives of those around him. That takes a special kind of belief, a deep-seated conviction. Not just trying to make things better but the belief that things can—and should—be better and that the result of doing so would benefit the world.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009108\\n\\nIn fact, when I visited the Toyota Museum in Toyota City (because of course this is the story of Toyota Motor Company), the loom they have in the lobby is not Sakichi’s crowning glory. Quite the opposite: It’s a broken loom. A failure. Because to Sakichi, that symbolized what his companies were truly about: kaizen, continuous improvement. This is not unlike Thomas Edison’s famous quip about the lightbulb: “I have not failed 10,000 times; I have found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”\\n\\nAt some point, thieves broke into one of Sakichi’s factories and stole the plans for a loom. Sakichi’s son said, “The thieves may be able to follow the design plans and produce a loom. But we are modifying and improving our looms every day. . . . They do not have the expertise gained from the failures it took to produce the original. . . . We need only continue as always, making our improvements.”2\\n\\nThis was the spirit of Toyota: even in their failures, they learned to succeed. You can clearly see this when “the first car from the Orient”3 came ashore in the US in 1957. It came in the form of a Toyopet. This is how awful the car was: “there was no guarantee you’d get to the top of the hill, but if you wanted to increase your chances, it was better to do it in reverse.”4 It’d go zero to sixty in all of twenty-six seconds. Heavy and slow, it was well suited for Japan’s still decimated, rough mountainous roads. The paved highways of the California coast? Not so much. If it weren’t apparent to the casual observer that the Toyo- pet wasn’t designed for the American market, all they needed to do was go to a drive-in movie theater: the traditional tray that hooked onto the steering wheel to hold your burger and malt would rest against the middle of the steer- ing wheel, blowing the horn during the middle of the movie. Plus, its very name evoked images of teacup poodles.\\n\\nToyota sold all of two hundred cars and lost every penny of $1.42 million.5 The company took the car off the market, went back to their Koromo fac- tory . . . and promptly came back with the Corona, the predecessor to the wildly successful Corolla and Camry. This is a great example of the culture that Dem- ing was being immersed in. It wasn’t that the Toyopet was a terrible car. In fact, it was a fine car for Japan; the Toyopet holds the distinction of being Toyota’s longest manufactured passenger car, currently on generation fourteen. It was just a terrible car for America. Whereas the typical American company would have spent years licking its wounds and bemoaning the debacle, the spirit of Sakichi saw only opportunity.\\n\\nWhen Ed came to spread the gospel of continuous improvement in 1950, he was preaching to the choir. Toyota already believed in it. Ed simply gave them a process to better understand how to progress from failure. The idea of\\n\\nCHAPTER 12: MADE IN JAPAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009109\\n\\never-improving coupled with what they learned from Deming—especially the Theory of Knowledge and shorter feedback loops via the PDSA loop, as well as the Theory of Variation and the accompanying statistical process control—let them succeed in their failure.\\n\\nKaizen. As mentioned, there was another element of culture that readily dovetailed with what Ed taught, not just at Toyota but in the greater Japanese culture: acting as a collective, unlike the typical American approach of rugged individu- alism. When someone mopped the floors in a Toyota factory, they weren’t just cleaning. They were making the cars that their family, friends, and neighbors would drive. They were rebuilding their country for their fellow citizens and their children. There was some serious purpose pushing the top end of that mop stick.\\n\\nPerhaps this oft told story from two “greats” in the automaker world sums up the East vs. West approach. While president at General Motors, Alfred Sloan purportedly said, “We aren’t in the business of making cars. We’re in the business of making money.” On the other side of the Pacific, a rising star at Toyota Motors would come to say, “We don’t make great cars. We make great people who make cars.”\\n\\nThat rising star was a man whose surname was pronounced “Oh, no.”\\n\\nThe Toyota Way\\n\\nJust-in-time (JIT) manufacturing was the brainchild of the self-taught Jap- anese industrial engineer Taiichi Ohno. During a trip to study Henry Ford’s famous River Rouge plant in Michigan in 1956, Ohno visited a local Piggly Wiggly and was inspired by the shelves’ inventories being replaced just in time as they ran out. For eight years, Ohno had begun laying the groundwork for what would become just-in-time methods, but seeing is believing: Piggly Wiggly was the tipping point where Ohno went all-in on his fledgling just-in- time practices.\\n\\nOhno started as a loom machinist for Sakichi Toyoda’s company, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in 1932; the next year, Sakichi created the auto manu- facturing division. By the time Ohno had traded looms for cars, the division had been spun off as Toyota Motor Corporation.* He packed his bags and headed for its factory in Koromo, just east of Nagoya.\\n\\nIn Japanese, toyoda means “fertile rice paddies.” Sakichi’s son-in-law Risaburo, not nearly as attached to the name as those born with it, suggested a slight tweak. Funnily enough, most Americans still pronounce it “Toyoda.”\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009110\\n\\nThe day before Emperor Hirohito made his radio address to surrender in 1945, Allied bombers targeted the Toyota factory. Luckily for all of us, Ohno wasn’t a casualty. The following year, he was promoted to head of the machine shop. Or, at least, what was left of it by that point.\\n\\nWhere others may have seen bleak prospects, Ohno saw Koromo as a play- ground. He intuitively began rearranging the operation, workflows, and layout of the entire shop floor. Embodying the spirit of kaizen that was infused into the company by Sakichi Toyoda and his son Kiichirō Toyoda, the machin- ist-turned-industrial-engineer constantly improved and innovated. By 1948, he’d begun experimenting with just-in-time methods. His boss—mechanical engi- neer Eiji Toyoda, nephew of Sakichi—approved. Ohno, Eiji, and Kiichirō would become largely responsible for the powerhouse that Toyota would come to be.\\n\\nDue to their efforts, Toyota Motor Corporation\\n\\ndeliberately avoided copying foreign models or techniques and focused on developing a more efficient production system uniquely tailored to the needs of the Japanese market.\\n\\nToyota, and then other Japanese automakers, did not simply imple- ment [American] processes more effectively; they made critical changes in US procedures and concepts. Their creativity led to greater flexibility in equipment and labor, lower in-process inventories and higher overall turnover rates, more attention to process quality, and, ultimately, higher levels of productivity.6\\n\\nToyota’s leaders charted Toyota’s own path. Before and even during World War II, US companies like Ford churned out as many finished products as pos- sible. Because demand and profit margins were so high, US companies could afford waste, rework, stockpiling inventory, and other inefficiencies. Henry Ford and his followers made money at scale: the more cars they made, the cheaper they could make them.*\\n\\nJapanese automakers couldn’t afford big plants like Ford’s River Rouge. As an island nation with limited arable land, real estate is at a premium. Toyota couldn’t afford to buy hundreds of acres to use as parking lots for unsold cars. Financially, Ford’s operations were big enough that he could afford to have mil- lions of dollars’ worth of inventory sitting on shelves. He could afford to have hundreds of unfinished cars going through his factories at a time.\\n\\nKind of like being a member of a wholesale club like Costco: you get a bigger discount buying in\\n\\nbulk.\\n\\nCHAPTER 12: MADE IN JAPAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009111\\n\\nToyota couldn’t afford those luxuries. In fact, during the postwar years, they couldn’t afford much of anything. They had to find ways to turn Toyota into a lean, mean, automaking machine with little margin for error.* Kiichirō, Eiji, and Ohno made three important decisions—three concepts that have become staples of successful manufacturing for over fifty years now:\\n\\n1. Streamline their manufacturing process to wring out every ounce of\\n\\nwaste they possibly could (a.k.a. just-in-time manufacturing).\\n\\n2. Institute statistical process control, not only at Toyota but in their huge\\n\\nnetwork of suppliers.\\n\\n3. Produce in small lots (instead of massive batches like Ford and GM).\\n\\nJust-in-time manufacturing was Ohno’s contribution. As Taylorism showed, the manufacturing process had a lot of waste, and Ohno attacked waste with a vengeance. But where Taylorism focused on eliminating indi- vidual waste, Ohno focused on systemic waste. Assembly-line workers were cross-trained in different positions so that while they were on the clock, they were always adding value. They might run multiple machines. They might be inspecting their own work and the quality of the parts and products that came to them. If nothing else, they’d get a broom and sweep the floors. In American factories, plenty of parts, components, and inventory sat idle on the shelf or shop floor. In Toyota’s factories, they didn’t stockpile inventory. Like Piggly Wiggly, wanting just enough on their shelves for their next round of customers, Toyota wanted just enough in their inventory to be ready for the next lot of cars coming down the line.\\n\\nNot even machines escaped the efficiency expert’s notice. Ohno wanted to eliminate idle time for the equipment the workers used as well. His solution was to make the machines multipurpose. By reconfiguring some components, a stamping machine, for example, could stamp out a higher number of different metal parts.\\n\\nThere was also another engineer named Shigeo Shingo—and this is where Shingo truly shined. By closely studying the tasks for each machine’s reconfig- uration, he could turn a two-hour changeover process into a matter of minutes, sometimes even with a complicated machine that previously took half the day\\n\\nThey couldn’t know their situation was a textbook example of what business management\\n\\nexpert Eliyahu Goldratt—famous for his business novel The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improve- ment with seven million copies sold since its 1984 publication—would come to call his “theory of constraints.” In a nutshell, the theory says, “Hey, we’ve got to build our business around the weakest link in the chain.”\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009112\\n\\nto switch over.* Nothing—from spare parts to machines to people—sat idle around the Koromo factory for very long.\\n\\nKiichirō Toyoda’s major contribution was instituting statistical process control à la Deming, but he took it one step further. As early as the 1930s, Toy- ota created an interconnected network of vendors, suppliers, and subsidiaries. Despite (or because of) the war, this was firmly established by the time Dem- ing came with Stuart Rice’s mission. Once Kiichirō and his managers grasped statistical process control, they began rolling it out to their suppliers too. These suppliers became so integrated into Toyota that they functioned more like components in a supply-chain system rather than a series of supply-and- demand transactions.\\n\\nI imagine it was Kiichirō and Ohno working together who created the final keystone of their weakest-link management theory: small-lot manufacturing. How small? The year Deming began his 1950 lectures, the whole of Japan produced 31,597 automobiles7 . . . about what the US made in a day. Six years later, when Eiji Toyoda and Ohno visited the River Rouge plant, Toyota still manufactured only 2,500 autos a year compared with Ford’s eight thousand cars every twenty-four hours.8 Toyota couldn’t afford to make a little money off a lot of cars; it needed to make a lot of money off a few cars.\\n\\nYou have to appreciate how radical a pursuit this was. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, titans of industry had focused on economies of scale: “How do we make more for less?” In a sense, Kiichirō, Eiji, Ohno, and Shingo were industrial revolutionaries against the Industrial Revolution by flipping convention on its head. Their question was “How do we make more with less?”\\n\\nAs is the theme of this book, this idea—small-lot manufacturing—may have been inspired by something else. For instance, while Ohno was at Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in the 1930s, the company began losing business to the Nichibo company. The rival undercut Toyoda in costs yet produced at higher quality by manufacturing in small lot sizes.9\\n\\nToyota’s three decisions (just-in-time manufacturing, continuous improve- ment at the mother plant and its suppliers, and small-lot production) culminated in the practice of kanban. As Ohno would say, the aim was to produce only what was needed, when it was needed, and in the amount needed.10 Think of it like two different fast-food chains. McDonald’s makes a big batch of fries, then sells them until they’re gone. That’s why it’s a crapshoot whether your fries will be crispy and fresh one day but mushy and old another. Then there are made-to-\\n\\nKnown as single-minute exchange of die (SMED). The essence of SMED in converting a\\n\\nmachine from one use to another is to do as much of the conversion work while the machine is still running and streamline those steps that can’t.\\n\\nCHAPTER 12: MADE IN JAPAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009113\\n\\norder fast-food chains like In-N-Out Burger. The burger patty doesn’t hit the grill until the customer puts in their order. Their burgers are always freshly cooked and taste amazing, part of why In-N-Out has a cult-like following.*\\n\\nLike McDonald’s, the automakers in Motor City made huge batches of cars—it was up to the dealerships to sell them all. They call this a “push sys- tem”: the factory makes as much as possible, then pushes its inventory onto the dealership, who then has to convince customers to buy—or else. (No won- der car salespeople gained a reputation for being so pushy: in order to survive in a push-type system, they had to!)\\n\\nSimilar to In-N-Out Burger, Toyota created a “pull system”: the factory didn’t begin manufacturing another car until the dealership had sold the first one. Kanban went against everything Henry Ford and his disciples believed and practiced.\\n\\nIn 1962, Karou Ishikawa introduced “quality circles” and offered a course through JUSE. You might think of it as a kaizen continuous-improvement club. Workers whose jobs overlapped would work together to increase productivity flows between each other.\\n\\nEventually, this group of ideas formed the core of the now world-famous\\n\\nToyota Way:\\n\\nKaizen: continuous improvement (predating Shewhart but perhaps\\n\\ninspired by Sakichi reading Henry Ford’s book). • Jidoka: the machine stops when there’s a problem. • Andon cord: any worker can stop the assembly line when there’s a\\n\\nproblem.\\n\\nHaving grown up on Long Island, living on the West Coast has never appealed to me. I enjoy visiting Los Angeles, and San Francisco is the heart of my industry’s world, but I’ve turned down a number of fantastic opportunities to live out there. One of the “pulls” my would-be recruiters always used, tongue-in-cheek, was In-N-Out Burger. Being from the East Coast, I’ve always been a Five Guys kind of guy. They make a burger and fries that’s hard to beat. But one time on a trip to LA, I tried a taste test. No contest: Five Guys won.\\n\\nI tweeted something to the effect of the West Coast burger bias. A friend texted me, “Did you ask for animal style?” I texted back, “They didn’t have that on the menu.” That’s when I discovered that you have to ask for it. I thought, What a West Coast thing, like a secret handshake or a modern speakeasy: you don’t know unless you’re in “the know.” How good was it? I’ll say this: The next time I was in Utah, instead of touring the local sites, I had an Uber drive my kids and me sixty miles round-trip to the nearest one. Just for a dou- ble-double, animal style. Worth it. My next trip out West, I ordered a double-double, animal style.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009114\\n\\nGo to gemba:* the supervisor immediately goes to the source of the\\n\\nproblem.\\n\\nJust-in-time and kanban: replacing push systems with pull, “made-to-\\n\\norder,” systems.\\n\\nThese practices had either begun or were well established by the time Deming began his 1950s seminars, a great example of how Japan influenced Deming as much as he influenced the country. Years later, after Japanese auto- makers—led by Toyota—crushed the American car market, US executives were eager to learn. What they learned wasn’t a regurgitation of Shewhart, but a beautiful fusion of Deming’s Western practices and Eastern ideas.\\n\\nThe CEO of Ford once remarked of Deming, “He feels that he did not cause the great transformation that occurred in Japanese management and manufac- turing. Rather, the Japanese caused these changes themselves.”11\\n\\nIn Japan, Ed encountered a culture that offered a stark contrast to West- ern business practices, Toyota being the poster child of Japanese thinking. The company was, as Steven Spear calls it, a community of scientists.12 In general, Japan embraced a culture of failure and—as Ed had been preaching for years—placed blame squarely on the shoulders of managers and the man- ufacturing process instead of the worker. Moreover, he found a culture of intrinsically motivated employees, something he’d vaguely glimpsed at Haw- thorne Works.\\n\\nIn Mike Rother’s Toyota Kata, he tells the story of how at Toyota when an Andon cord was pulled, potentially bringing the entire assembly line to a grind- ing halt, the first thing a manager would do is “go to gemba,” or the source of the problem. Even before understanding the reason behind it, they would thank the worker for stopping operations.13 A reporter once asked the supervisor of a Toyota plant in Kentucky how the site could churn out over two thousand cars a day. The supervisor replied, “It’s simple. We pull the Andon cord 5,000 times a day.14 Instead of being a blame-first culture, Toyota saw these interruptions as opportunities to learn how to improve the product and process.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, when the quality revolution was underway in America, many US companies looked to the Japanese, and especially Toyota, to learn how to be competitive. The Toyota Way inspired what we now call “lean manufacturing,” itself a product of Deming’s ideas around Profound Knowledge accompanied, infused, and exemplified by Japanese business culture practices. As the quote introducing this chapter stated, “Deming is the core of our management.”\\n\\nProperly: genba.\\n\\nCHAPTER 12: MADE IN JAPAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009115\\n\\nThe Deming Obscurity\\n\\n“There was one . . . thing that bothered the Japanese . . . : Americans’ shameful ignorance of W. Edwards Deming. Deming was an American expert on quality control, and by the late fifties he had become something of a god in Japan.”15 To the Japanese, he was a prophet, oracle, diviner, and beloved teacher. To the Americans? He embodied a verse in the Book of Matthew: “And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him. Then Jesus told them, ‘A prophet is hon- ored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family.’ ”16\\n\\nThe America of the fifties and sixties . . . scorned Deming and his teach- ing and [had] in effect driven him abroad to find his students. America in those years was rich and unchallenged. . . . The theory of management then asserting itself in American business was a new one: Managers should no longer be of the plant. They should come from the managerial class, as it arrived from the best colleges and business schools. . . . Their experience should not be practical. . . . Practical experience was, if any- thing, a handicap.17\\n\\nThe US had no use for its native son. American companies didn’t need people with technical degrees to advise managers and executives. Manufactur- ing was no longer about quality but quantity. Deming used to tell the story about the engineer who worked for Western Electric during the war. The sol- dier returned in the mid-fifties to find the sister company of Walter Shewhart’s organization didn’t use control charts anymore.18 That’s how low a priority quality had become.\\n\\nNot for want of effort on Ed’s part. He’d tried to sound the alarm. He pub- lished an article in 1953 entitled “Management’s Responsibility for the Use of Statistical Techniques in Industry.” But he found himself stymied at every turn: “I was lighting a lot of fires, but they were all going out.”19\\n\\nEd was to spend the next quarter-century as the true-life embodiment of the Greek prophetess Cassandra: a seer able to divine the future but cursed so that no one listening would ever believe. He tried to warn American manag- ers about their businesses’ inevitably being eclipsed. But no one paid him any attention.\\n\\nRemember, Ed was born in 1900. He was forty-six on his first trip to Japan. During his fifties, he became that nation’s beloved professor. He was sixty-eight when the country overtook West Germany to become the second-largest econ- omy in the world. What did he do during the intervening decades?\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009116\\n\\nHe didn’t languish. According to his long-time assistant Cecelia Kilian, or simply “Ceil,”* Ed stayed busy. Aside from teaching part-time at New York University (and, later, Columbia), Ed took what amounted to odd jobs here and there as a statistician.\\n\\nDeming scholar Peter B. Petersen provided an example of when a city sued a pipe manufacturer for producing defective gas pipes. Because the pipelines were buried and too difficult to completely unearth to assess the damage, the parties agreed to use a sampling procedure to determine the extent. The city was going to win; it was just a question of how big of a check the manufacturer would have to write. The Prophet was brought in as an expert witness to testify about the sampling methods used.†20\\n\\nHe found a loyal clientele in the trucking industry. He served as an expert witness (mostly related to motor freight rates and such). He lectured all over the world, from Argentina to New Zealand. He took on an interesting and, in some cases almost absurd, mix of statistical research topics, including:\\n\\ncommunity surveys • mental health problems in deaf populations • newspaper subscription rates • fertility rates in schizophrenic patients • twin savants21 • financial auditing • nursing homes\\n\\nIf he wasn’t traveling between engagements and the apartment he kept\\n\\nnear NYU, he was biking, gardening, composing, or entertaining.\\n\\nEd wasn’t a man of material things. One of his children recalled that he would use a felt-tip pen to date the eggs in the refrigerator to be sure to use them before they went bad. When he hosted the Japanese who’d made the pil- grimage to 4924 Butterworth Place in DC, his modest, dated home and style of living impressed his guests. Often, they would have just finished meeting with Fortune 500 executives who wore $1,000 Armani suits and $200 shoes. Con- trast that with their meeting with Ed, his basement office sharing space with the home’s washer and dryer. I can only imagine how baffled they must have been by the contrast.\\n\\nShe came to work part-time for Deming in 1954. † This is an example of “jurimetrics,” applying statistics and probability methods in legal\\n\\nproceedings.\\n\\nCHAPTER 12: MADE IN JAPAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009117\\n\\nLola continued working for Uncle Sam during the week. On Saturday mornings, her three girls would routinely wake up to the sound of their mother at the calculator as she ran the books on Ed’s business.\\n\\nOne of them, Linda, would later recall an experience. After a nearby dirt road was paved, her father became concerned at the plight of a family of turtles that’d become disoriented. Every morning, “the family would troop out of the house to pick up all the turtles who were confused by the . . . paved road and move them to the other side.” Later, she would never see a turtle again without thinking of her father.22\\n\\nHis daughter Diana remembers him as an expert kite maker. Her kites would continue flying proud while the other neighborhood kids’ kites had fallen. (I suppose he was able to put his engineering degrees to use after all . . . and I have no doubt he used statistical process control and PDSA to continually make them even better.)\\n\\nEver the humanist, Ed rewrote “The Star-Spangled Banner” so that it would be easier for the majority of Americans to sing their own national anthem. He would go on to use this as a metaphor for systems thinking: if singers can’t hit the notes, don’t blame the singers—rewrite the song. In other words, don’t blame the workers for a poorly managed system. Just fix the system.\\n\\nWas it hard to be revered in a foreign country and virtually unknown in\\n\\nhis own?\\n\\nLinda once said, “I know it was frustrating to him. Whether he would admit it, I don’t know. He’s a very proud man. But I think he hurt. It’s hard to have your mission and not have anyone listen.”23\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009118\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\nRising Sun, Falling Eagle\\n\\nYou know how the Japanese can make things this way and we can’t? They kaizen ’em. A process of deliberate, patient, continual refinements. Each year the products get a little better, a little smaller, a little cheaper. Americans don’t think that way. Americans are always looking for the quantum leap, the big advance forward. Americans try to hit a home run—to knock it out of the park—and then sit back. The Japanese just hit singles all day long, and they never sit back. So with something like this, you’re looking at an expression of philosophy as much as anything.\\n\\n—Michael Crichton, Rising Sun\\n\\nWhile companies all over Japan were successfully implementing Deming’s teachings, Toyota stands out. As I said, the Toyota Way would soon become the world standard in industrial manufacturing, not just in the automotive busi- ness but in virtually every industry. In fact, the Toyota factory in Koromo was so successful that by 1959 the city decided to rename itself Toyota City.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Detroit . . .\\n\\nA Tale of Two Cities\\n\\nIn the IT world, they sometimes refer to the Red Queen’s Race from when Alice went back to Wonderland. The Red Queen and Alice ran like the wind. When they stopped, to the little girl’s astonishment, they were exactly where they’d started. She remarked,\\n\\n“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.”\\n\\n“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”1\\n\\nBy 1965, Toyota City was running twice as fast; Detroit didn’t even know\\n\\nthere was a race.\\n\\n“The moral of the [US automobile plant supervisor]’s experience is, never buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday. On those days, the workforce stays out in droves. Anybody who can hold a tool is pressed into service to keep assembly lines moving.”2 That’s from the New York Times in 1971. Autoworkers at the Big Three wanted to skip Fridays to get the party started early. Mondays, they were so hungover they couldn’t come to work. Dealers and those “in the know” would specify that only cars built on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays be sent to their dealership—all the lemons and shoddy workmanship got dumped on the unsuspecting. And this was normal. Expected. Planned for.*\\n\\nIn 1955, while Japan was still recovering from the war, Toyota averaged four vehicles produced per employee. Ford and GM, on the other hand, were producing ten per employee.

One Ford employee making ten cars a year for thirty-five years while his Toyota counterpart goes from four to sixty. Toyota’s supplier network? A typical GM car factory used eight hundred suppliers. Toyota? Just 125 . . . with half the in-house work. This dispels the Western myth of needing more to do more: Toyota was doing more with less. Less outsourcing meant greater control and greatly reduced variation.\\n\\nToyota’s suppliers loved working with the company. As late as the early 2000s, Toyota’s network rated the carmaker 350 points out of 500, putting it in the “good to very good” category. GM’s suppliers rated their relationship with the US carmaker at 125—“poor.”\\n\\nToyota didn’t just dominate US markets—it decimated them. What Detroit lacked, and what Toyota had in abundance, was an apprecia- tion of Profound Knowledge. By the 1950s, statistical process control and the PDSA loop had all but vanished from US manufacturing as “things got back to normal.” By the same token, in the 1950s Japan had started benefiting from Deming evangelizing his solidifying ideas of Profound Knowledge. By 1965, Toyota was using all four elements of the System of Profound Knowledge to rocket past their American counterparts.\\n\\nMade in America\\n\\nHow? How did the company of Sakichi Toyoda—himself a devotee of Henry Ford—come to surpass, nay, eclipse its American ancestor in spirit? In the eighties, theories abounded. The Japanese had a better work ethic; American workers were lazy. Japanese auto manufacturers invested more in their equip- ment and technology than US companies.\\n\\nThe 1986 movie Gung Ho was a comedy about a failing US auto plant that was saved at the midnight hour by a Japanese company. New managers were sent over to replace the Americans. Otherwise, everything stayed the same. Same workers, same cars, same equipment.\\n\\nThere’s a particular scene that pretty much sums up the difference between East and West at this time. The protagonist, Michael Keaton, is sort of the American workforce’s representative to the top brass. Knowing that the Jap- anese love baseball, he invites them to play a “friendly” game with a simple wager:\\n\\nKeaton: “We just play for beer.” Japanese manager: “So do we!” Keaton: “And afterwards, we piss for distance.” Japanese manager: “For us, it’s accuracy.”4\\n\\nCHAPTER 13: RISING SUN, FALLING EAGLE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009121\\n\\nIf that doesn’t capture East versus West thinking, I don’t know what does. In the end, it’s a feel-good movie. The Americans and Japanese learn from each other and pull together a last-minute montage (gotta love the eighties), where they race to rescue the plant from being closed yet again. It being a movie, all of this was fictional.\\n\\nExcept it wasn’t. By 1984, GM realized things had to drastically change. It created a joint venture with Toyota. The resulting company, New United Motor Manufactur- ing, Inc. (NUMMI), used GM’s old car factory in Fremont, California. Whether on purpose or by serendipity, the Fremont plant was the worst of the worst. The workers’ union, UAW, said so itself: “[They were] the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States.”5\\n\\nThey were bad on purpose. One worker revealed that they would drink on the job, then throw the empty beer bottles and cans into the car door panels before welding them shut—a literal rattletrap. Productivity was abysmal. You could take the script from Gung Ho and change the names to protect the guilty. GM finally shut it down in 1982.\\n\\nBut by 1984, GM was desperate to learn how Toyota operated, and the execs in Toyota City wanted a US-based plant that would allow them to avoid tariffs and import restrictions. And so, NUMMI was opened in the Fremont, California, plant. The UAW union demanded they hire all the old workers back. GM balked, but Toyota acquiesced. Some 85% of the workforce that joined NUMMI were the same ones from the days of abysmal production. Almost from day one, NUMMI was making cars as fast as plants in Toyota City, and at the same level of quality. To the consternation of GM managers, who had assumed more automation and more advanced technology was the secret, Toyota didn’t install any new machines or tech at NUMMI. Quite the opposite: They removed some of the automation that had been in place; the plant was less advanced under Toyota than it had been under GM.\\n\\nYou have to appreciate how beautiful of a social experiment this was. By the scientific method, an experiment changes only one variable at a time. Other wise, how do you know what really caused the change? NUMMI was that experiment. Same workers, same equipment, same cars, same (almost) every- thing. The one variable that changed was the management system.\\n\\nToyota didn’t allow GM to run the plant the way it had in the past. The Jap- anese insisted on using the Toyota Way, running NUMMI like any other Toyota plant. That meant a blameless culture centered around quality and continuous improvement. Perhaps more importantly, it was a culture based on respect for the role of the employee (this stems from a theory of psychology and an appre-\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009122\\n\\nciation of systems). As a result, the exact same workers who put empty beer bottles in door panels were now proud—proud!—of the work they did. One worker went so far as to slip his business card under the windshield wiper of a car he knew had been produced at NUMMI that was parked outside a restau- rant. He penciled a note: “I helped to build your car.”6\\n\\nWhen I point to NUMMI in some of my presentations, I’ve had plenty of people come up to me afterward and say, “Well, John, you know, they had to close the factory down.”\\n\\nToyota did . . . but only because GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and left Toyota holding the bag. Because of the way their deal was originally structured, Toyota couldn’t profitably operate the plant on its own.\\n\\nBut instead of just locking the doors and walking away, the Japanese auto- maker ran the facility at a loss for nine months to wind down operations and properly shut it down. On top of employing everyone during this period, Toy- ota also funded a $281 million severance package for all 4,700 workers there. NUMMI—and, by extension, the System of Profound Knowledge—didn’t\\n\\nfail; GM went bankrupt and screwed Toyota in the process.\\n\\nStealing the Loom\\n\\nAt least a decade before NUMMI, American companies had begun reaching out to the Japanese to propose such joint operations. In 1975, one paper company proposed to be the distributor for Ricoh printers and even sent executives across the Pacific to learn from their new partners. The Japanese approach to manufacturing began to make its way into the mainstream busi- ness consciousness by 1977 with the publication of two articles. One was by an American that touted Toyota’s “Ohno system,” titled “Toyota’s famous Ohno system.”7 The other was by a group of Toyota executives in a profes- sional journal entitled “Toyota Production System and Kanban System: Materialization of Just-in-time and Respect-for-human System.”8 Americans started coming to Japan en masse to figure out why their world had been turned upside down.\\n\\nBy 1984, it was reported that a number of US manufacturers had adopted just-in-time manufacturing, including GE, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, John Deere, and Black and Decker.9 The progress made was nothing short of extraordinary.\\n\\nThat same year, an American engineer named John Krafcik landed his first professional job: quality and manufacturing engineer at the new NUMMI fac- tory. He learned so much from his Toyota coworkers that in 1986 he joined MIT’s\\n\\nCHAPTER 13: RISING SUN, FALLING EAGLE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009123\\n\\nprestigious automotive research center, the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation.* As part of US manufacturers’ lobbying efforts, the National Science Foundation funded university grants to figure out what the hell was happening. Krafcik received one such grant, allowing him to visit ninety factories across twenty countries. From this, he coined an umbrella term that encompassed all this research and experience: “lean.” In a nutshell, he said that it wasn’t nation- ality, capital, or technology that made one manufacturing plant better than another. Adopting a lean manufacturing philosophy—the one he’d seen first- hand at NUMMI—trumped all those other factors.\\n\\nUS manufacturers sat up and took notice. Finally, here was something they could do. This spawned what we now call the “American Quality Revolution.” New methodologies—from Total Quality Management to Six Sigma—sprang up, and a cottage industry of lean consultants came into being as companies scrambled to copy Toyota and other such leading Japanese organizations.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of lean manufacturing became so prevalent that even reluctant companies were forced to adopt it. That, or go bankrupt as their competitors continually lowered prices while raising the bar on quality. Today, virtually every plant, mill, factory, or other industrial production-related com- pany and site uses some form of lean methodology.\\n\\nWhile US companies read about Toyota’s “just-in-time” system, they rarely embraced the “respect-for-human” side of the equation. They focused on the process but forgot the people.\\n\\nThe consequences of this still show up today. For example, by the time GM rolled out its hybrid vehicle, the Chevy Volt, Toyota’s Prius had already been on the market for a decade. By 2010, GM had sold about one hundred thou- sand Volts versus Toyota’s total hybrid sales of nine million. Even though lean manufacturing was becoming widespread, GM had picked up only tools and methods from Toyota. They had vastly improved since the 1970s, but they still couldn’t keep up. In the time it took GM to catch up, Toyota had been contin- uously improving. What GM lacked was a systemic understanding of Profound Knowledge. GM, like other American companies, had copied the methods but not the motives. Companies needed more than smarter manufacturing: They needed smarter management.\\n\\nDuring the Japanese economic invasion of the 1960s and 1970s, Ed still sat on the sidelines, honored like a god in Japan but considered a prophet without honor in his own country.

Which one? Kevin would have to figure that out.\\n\\n—Dennis Scergent via Ron Moen\\n\\nOn May 15, 1981, executives from Ford Motor Company, the largest automaker in the world, flew the corporate jet from their headquarters in Detroit to an airstrip barely big enough to classify as an airport in the backwoods of New Hampshire. About 68,000 people called Nashua home. Its biggest claim to fame wouldn’t occur for another twenty-five years, as a branch office of the Dunder-Mifflin paper company in the TV show The Office. Coincidentally, the Ford executives had come to Nashua to study a small paper company. Perhaps underscoring the already provincial quality of the area, the paper company was even named after the town: Nashua Corporation.\\n\\nOriginally a textile mill town, Nashua’s last factory closed in 1949. Fortu- nately for the local economy, eleven engineers from Vannevar Bush’s Raytheon moved into one of the old mills and founded their own defense contractor operation in 1951, today part of BAE Systems. In the 1970s, the computer firm Digital Equipment Corporation moved into town as well. These high-tech firms attracted others, turning the town into an extension of the Boston high- tech corridor. These companies apparently rubbed off on Nashua Corporation. Although famous for manufacturing playing cards, by the 1970s, its leadership had refocused on electronics.\\n\\nIn 1954, Bill Conway joined Nashua Corporation as an industrial engineer. By 1969, he’d worked his way up to become president of the company. In season six of The Office, failing Dunder-Mifflin is bought out by a printer company that plans to use the paper company’s distribution network to sell its printers to offices and small businesses throughout the Northeast. Perhaps this was\\n\\nConway’s thinking when he entered into an agreement with the copier com- pany Ricoh to distribute its products outside North America. To understand their new Japanese partner better, in 1974 Conway sent a few of his own exec- utives to Ricoh’s headquarters in Tokyo. Upon their return, Conway asked the vice president of research and development, “How’d the meeting go?”\\n\\nThe VP recounted that everybody was\\n\\nfuriously engaged in preparations for something they call the “Deming Prize.” The Americans had no idea what they were talking about. . . . On hearing this story, Conway’s curiosity was piqued. “Prize? What the hell is the Deming Prize?” The Nashua vice-president told Conway that as far as he could tell “it was all about statistics and charts, and geez they’re all nuts, they’re all crazy. They’re all working on it.” “Who’s working on it,” asked Conway. “Everyone,” replied the vice-president. “The president of Ricoh is involved . . . sales managers, administrative people, engineers, manufacturers, everybody’s working on the Deming Prize.1\\n\\n(And yes, Ricoh won the Deming Prize in 1975.) In 1978, Conway himself toured Ricoh’s facilities in both Tokyo and Cali- fornia. He “got an appreciation of the level at which they were operating.”2 To his surprise, he found that this Deming guy was still alive and well in Washing- ton, DC. The next year, he held a strategy meeting with his top management. By this time, Conway had turned Nashua Corporation into a Fortune 500 tech company, manufacturing floppy disks and imaging products. They realized how far behind the Japanese they were—and how quickly American companies were falling further behind in this global Red Queen’s race. They called Dem- ing on a Tuesday; by Friday, the seventy-nine-year-old man arrived in Nashua. Keep in mind, this was a year before “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?” aired. Deming said that Nashua was the first American company to fully listen to the rest of his teachings. This was thirty years after he’d begun working with Japanese industry. Without the 1980 documentary, it might have been another thirty years before he got his second client. Who knows?\\n\\nThe timing couldn’t have been more fortuitous. When NBC producer Clare Crawford-Mason began investigating Deming in earnest, one of her fears was that the consultant’s methods would work for only Japanese companies. Did he happen to have any American clients? While Deming had plenty of clients he’d consulted for in the US, there was only one that had begun implementing his ideas around Profound Knowledge. Fortunately for Crawford-Mason, that one client had incredible credibility by virtue of being a high-tech manufacturing Fortune 500 company.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009128\\n\\nEven so, she was still on the fence about moving forward with the story. When she reached out to Conway, he could have taken all the credit for the transformation. If he had, Crawford-Mason wouldn’t have moved forward with the show, and the US would never have rediscovered its native son. Then again, Crawford-Mason wouldn’t even have found Deming if it weren’t for the serendip- ity of his being an affable neighbor of the dean of a business school. In the Forrest Gumpian life of his, he always seemed to have the good fortune of being in the right place at the right time. Crawford-Mason decided the gamble was worth it.\\n\\nConway was effusive in his praise on national TV:\\n\\nI would say that already we’re saving millions of dollars. Well, we’ve probably improved the overall productivity of the company, something in [the last] few years by 10% to 15% and that every year thereafter you take and get incremental increases in productivity of 4% or 5%, and I mean that over and above that which you’d get by normal capital invest- ments on normal changes in machinery and things like that.3\\n\\nWhen the NBC special aired in 1980, Ford Motor Company had posted a loss of over a billion dollars for the previous year. It was expected to lose another billion in 1980 (and did). Everyone knew why: They couldn’t compete against Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and other Japanese car manufacturers. But maybe, just maybe, a company in little ol’ Nashua, New Hampshire, had the answer to Ford’s problems.\\n\\nThe Ghost of Henry Ford\\n\\nWhen he watched “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?” Donald Petersen was the president and chief operating officer of Ford. Like Bill Conway and Ed Deming, Petersen was trained as an engineer. Then he’d earned his MBA from Stan- ford in 1949, just a handful of years after Deming’s Stanford classes. He went straight to work for Ford.\\n\\nLike for most North American manufacturers, the 1950s and 1960s were\\n\\ngolden years.\\n\\nLike for all North American auto manufacturers, the 1970s were not. In fact, not only did Ford’s losses make headlines, but the company had become known for its exploding Pintos. In an effort to compete with the smaller, more fuel-efficient imports, Ford had introduced the compact car. Unfortunately, when rear-ended, the small car had a habit of blowing up. A total of sixty-nine people were killed. Although acquitted, Ford became the first automaker charged with reckless homicide. What a way to be remembered.\\n\\nCHAPTER 14: DEMINGMANIA\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009129\\n\\nJust a few months after Deming was reintroduced to the US in 1980, a handful of Ford middle managers flew down to Washington to meet him in his cramped basement office. The meeting between the Prophet and the repre- sentatives of the fourth-largest company in the entire world lasted all of thirty minutes before Deming sent them out the door packing.\\n\\nTo the outside observer, this seems puzzling. Why would Deming have turned down a seemingly fantastic opportunity? He’d been working in relative obscurity for decades. The legendary Ford Motor Company was now asking him for help. Here, finally, was his big break. He’d made it. He was “in.” But Deming knew his methods could work only if the entire management team was com- mitted to the effort.\\n\\nThe ghost of Henry Ford was still alive and well in his namesake company.\\n\\nQuality was seen as a task—not a philosophy.\\n\\nMonths later, when Ford executives toured Nashua Corporation’s factory,\\n\\nthey\\n\\nwalked through the plant as though they were on an alien planet. The factory seemed to be missing one vital component . . . there was no formal inspection procedure, or what, at Ford, was known as a “buy- off” operation. For years US companies like Ford had relied on these “buy-offs” as part of their quality control process; at each stage of man- ufacturing, right until the finished products were shipped out the door, inspectors would monitor the materials, the work in progress, and the finished product. They would separate the good from the bad, some- times inspecting every last item.\\n\\nWhile Nashua had also practiced quality by inspection at one time,\\n\\nDeming led the company to abandon that system.4\\n\\nThe Prophet was willing to work with Nashua only because CEO Bill Con- way had led the effort. Conway had committed the entire company to this new philosophy of management. Not long after beginning his consulting there, Deming began to hold four-day seminars that ran all day long . . . based on the very same seminars he’d originally taught JUSE . . . based on the seminars he’d originally created for the Stanford classes. At Nashua, these were not just for management. No, that would run counter to everything Deming had learned after decades of working with Japanese companies. Everyone in the company attended his lectures, from record-keeping clerks to the CEO and even Nashua’s customers and suppliers.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009130\\n\\nIn these lectures, he taught not only practical statistics but six core man-\\n\\nagement principles:\\n\\n1. Work closely with a few suppliers. 2. Work closely with the customer. 3. Tear down the walls within the company. 4. Eliminate inspection. 5. Earn workers’ trust. 6. Continuously improve operations.\\n\\nThis is why Deming sent Ford’s middle managers on their way: their very presence was antithetical to his methods. They wanted to improve production quality; Deming wanted to improve the company. (This was the same situation Koyanagi faced with Sarasohn: the American wanted the Japanese engineers to focus on production, while the members of JUSE wanted to deploy continuous improvement throughout their companies.)\\n\\nJust these six management principles of Ed’s would require tremendous effort and resources to accomplish—that is, if the upper management of Ford could wrap their heads around the ideas in the first place . . . much less the middle managers sent to Deming’s little wood-paneled office.\\n\\nIt was all or nothing. But Ford president Donald Petersen wouldn’t take no for an answer. After several requests, Deming finally acquiesced to teach a seminar to thirty of Ford’s top executives, including Petersen himself. In the seminar, the Professor acted quite unprofessorially. He was abrasive. Abrupt. Contemptuous. Cantankerous. He refused to talk about quality issues. Everything was about management and management’s failure to manage well. He was, in short, unlike any consultant the top executives of one of the world’s largest and most prestigious companies had ever seen before. Nobody talked to them like that.\\n\\nBut the more Deming taught, the more Petersen listened. For him, some things were finally falling into place. Recall from the Mazda-Go story that Mazda had sold one-quarter of the company to Ford. (This happened the year before the NBC special.) Ford began manufacturing an identical transmission to Mazda’s. Customers and dealers, however, began saying the cars with trans- missions made in Japan were better than those made in America. This was clearly impossible since the transmissions were made to the exact same specifi- cations. Ford chalked it up to people believing (rightly so) that anything made in Japan was superior to anything made in the USA.\\n\\nCHAPTER 14: DEMINGMANIA\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009131\\n\\nUpon further investigation, though, Ford discovered something intrigu- ing. They took the transmissions apart and compared them, part for part. The American-made transmissions had a quality tolerance of one-eighth of an inch—exactly what the specs called for. The Mazda-made transmissions, however, had a tolerance of one-sixteenth of an inch. That is, the Japanese delivered twice the quality called for. They really were superior. But how? Why was Mazda twice as good as its American counterpart? No one could tell Petersen why. Most of the Ford engineers didn’t believe that simply tighten- ing tolerance limits was the answer to enhanced quality; they wanted a better explanation.\\n\\nUltimately, it was a question of pragmatism. Just as C. S. Pierce realized that there was a pragmatic limit to improving his pendulums, the Mazda engi- neers found the pragmatic, economic limit of reducing the tolerance limits of its transmissions. That’s why they stopped at one-sixteenth instead of going with an even tighter tolerance of one-thirty-second. At Ford, Ed was able to explain how to use statistical process control to find that pragmatic limit.\\n\\nWhen Ed lectured to those thirty execs, the wheels started turning. Finally, here was a man who not only had the answers but had taught Japanese man- ufacturers how to implement them in the first place. In short order, Petersen became a self-proclaimed Deming disciple. In fact, on his last day at Ford, Petersen wrote Deming a letter that concluded with the line “You have had a major impact on my life and my thinking. Your friend, Don.”5\\n\\nThe company rewrote its mission statement and drafted new guiding principles. Under Ed’s tutelage, Petersen turned the company from its insular approach to business to one that was customer focused. He would become famous for infusing something of a mantra in Ford by asking “Is this what you would want in your driveway?!” This way of thinking paved the way for the redesign of the wildly successful Ford Thunderbird as well as the creation of the Ford Taurus-Sable line.\\n\\nWith his retainer clients like Ford, Deming refused to work on specific problems. He always focused on teaching theory and principles, leaving the nitty-gritty details to the on-site statistician he’d approved and the client had hired. Some people at Ford began to privately question if he was all he was touted to be. One day, Deming heard about a problem that had baffled the experts at Ford for a year, a railroad transportation problem between a stamp- ing plant and an assembly facility. They had decided to give up completely. After listening to them explain the situation, Deming grabbed one of their con- trol charts and a pencil and found the solution in ten minutes flat. No one ever questioned the Prophet again.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009132\\n\\nWhen Ed stood before those top managers at Ford in 1981, he made a Mount Hakone–like prophecy: If Ford would do what he said, in five years they would lead the market. In 1986, Ford was the most profitable carmaker in America—a title it hadn’t held for over sixty years.\\n\\nSitting at the Feet of the Prophet\\n\\nOne month before Ford’s Mount Hakone moment, the company’s head of supplier quality met with Deming. Would the guru teach one of his four-day courses like he’d done at Nashua to some of Ford’s top suppliers?\\n\\nRepresentatives from ten suppliers came to the first seminar in May. It was so successful that Ford put on another one the following month. Then every month for the rest of the year. Then twice a month the following year. Soon, companies outside of Ford’s supply chain were clamoring for the seminars. The company decided to spin off its training division into its own entity. Dr. Deming and fellow engineer and statistician Dr. Genichi Taguchi founded what would become the American Supplier Institute.6*\\n\\nDespite now being eighty years old, Deming regularly began to teach thirty to forty of these four-day seminars around the country every year to organiza- tions as diverse as AT&T, Campbell Soup, CTI-Cryogenics, Duracell, GE, IBM, Monsanto, Pfizer, Boeing, Xerox, Procter & Gamble, Union Carbide Coatings, Westinghouse, Scott Paper, DuPont, Hewlett-Packard, Dow Chemical, and Hughes Aircraft, among others. He also greatly influenced Koch Industries as well as Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. These four-day seminars with Deming had a profound impact on American business and even politics.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t stop with manufacturing. It moved into software develop- ment. For example, one of my friends, Carmen DeArdo, once attended one of these “Four Days with Deming” seminars, as they came to be called. He took to it immediately, as he’d originally worked at Bell Labs and had been baptized in statistical process control. He took Deming’s teachings to Nationwide Insurance as its technology director and implemented it throughout their IT infrastruc- ture, finding a way to fuse Deming’s work into his own software development practices. DeArdo later became a leader in the DevOps community.\\n\\nAs Ed worked throughout the eighties, he continually refined his ideas and teachings around Profound Knowledge. Those six management principles he\\n\\nDr. Taguchi also developed the Taguchi Loss function to illustrate how variations within speci-\\n\\nfication limits lead to exponential customer dissatisfaction.\\n\\nCHAPTER 14: DEMINGMANIA\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009133\\n\\noriginally taught at Nashua soon morphed into his now-famous “14 Points for Management,” which he outlines in Out of the Crisis.\\n\\nA strong component of Deming’s approach to management is called MBM, or management by means, the counter to management by objectives (MBO) and management by results. The key difference between MBMs and MBOs is Deming would ask by what means did you achieve your goal? If you don’t know how you achieved your objective, how do you know if you can do it again? But when you understand the means, you can consistently achieve and even supersede your objectives. It’s the difference between giving a person fish and feeding them for a day and teaching them to fish and feeding them for life.\\n\\nHis approach to management is exemplified here in his 14 Points for Man-\\n\\nagement as presented on the Deming Institure website:7\\n\\n1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and ser- vice, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.\\n\\n2. Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsi- bilities, and take on leadership for change.\\n\\n3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.\\n\\n4. End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.\\n\\n5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.\\n\\n6. Institute training on the job. 7. Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers. 8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company. 9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service.\\n\\n10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity.

Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute lead- ership. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.\\n\\n12. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of work- manship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, inter alia, abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of manage- ment by objective.\\n\\n13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement. 14.

He was recruited as a mechanical engineer right out of college to be part of Northrup’s top- secret NSA project designing the B-2 stealth bomber as well as the F-117 stealth fighter. Over his career in aerospace and then in the automotive industry, he’s had the privilege to work with the “holy trinity of quality gurus,” as he puts it: Dr. Deming; Dr. Jeff Liker, author of The Toyota Way; and four-star general Bill Creech, author of The Five Pillars of TQM.\\n\\nWhen Northrup won the contract for the B-2, it knew that it was all or nothing: if it failed to deliver, the company would fold. So, the company sent sixteen of its best and brightest to CalTech to study systems engineering. The nucleus there was Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline and a giant in cybernetics thinking (a.k.a. systems thinking), especially when it came to information feedback loops.\\n\\nAfter a successful role at Northrup, Waraniak left to work for competi- tor Hughes Aircraft. In 1985, GM bought Hughes for $5 billion, in the largest acquisition in history outside of the energy industry; Waraniak was the first employee to transfer from the aerospace company to the auto manufacturer.\\n\\nCHAPTER 14: DEMINGMANIA\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009135\\n\\nFord topped GM in 1986 as the most profitable of the Big Three automo- bile manufacturers. It was no secret why. By then, everyone in Detroit knew about Ed Deming. Knowing Waraniak was a systems engineer, a boss pulled him aside to ask a simple question: How long would it take to incorporate this Deming stuff at GM? Waraniak said it would take three product generations: the first to teach it to all the engineers, the second to measure it against the new baseline, and the third to institutionalize it. Since a car model’s lifecycle is about five years, Waraniak was effectively saying that, going by the way GM operated, it’d take fifteen years.\\n\\n“We don’t have fifteen years,” his boss said. “I’m sending you over to\\n\\nMotorsports.”8\\n\\nIn racing, product development moves much more quickly: six to twelve months. Waraniak’s boss wanted him to spend three years in the racing divi- sion to prove to GM that Deming’s concepts worked. Then GM hired Deming to work with Waraniak’s team. (In an interview with me, Waraniak recalled flip- ping transparency slides for the Prophet.)\\n\\nBefore sending him off, his boss grabbed Waraniak by the tie and addressed him by his nickname: “Radar, I’m sending you to Motorsports to get inocu- lated—not to die from the disease.”9\\n\\nDeming’s methods paid off. Waraniak’s teams won the Triple Crown, the IndyCar, NASCAR championships—you name it. How? Using the theory of knowledge, he created more feedback/PDSA loops. Tradition at the time was to have only one car per team. It only made sense. I mean, they could race only one car at a time. GM also brought in Senge to consult. Waraniak, under the tutelage of Deming and Senge, didn’t focus on the race: he looked at the prepa- ration and training leading up to it. By using two cars and two teams in the design, training, and setup phases, GM could prototype twice the number of ideas and innovations. Then, when it came time to actually race, they’d use the best outcomes from both teams. In short, GM Motorsports could evolve twice as fast as every other team out there. It wasn’t long before their competitors wised up. Today, this is standard operating procedure. Deming and Waraniak changed motorsports as we know it.\\n\\nAfter watching a particularly bad crash—later, researchers would come to estimate the impact of the race car against the wall at sixty times the force of Earth’s gravity—Waraniak realized no one had any data on what exactly had happened. He went back to Hughes Aircraft, took an F-16’s black box, and strapped it to a racecar. For the first time in racing history, teams had car telemetry data. That is, a feedback loop. This technology evolved and would eventually create the basis for GM’s OnStar technology.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009136\\n\\nWaraniak did the same with the heads-up display (HUD) from a gunship. Originally the HUD-enabled helicopter helmet would allow the pilot to see where their guns were aimed. He took the HUD helmet and installed the tech- nology in a race car driver’s helmet. This technology eventually made its way into consumer cars. If your car has a HUD, thank Waraniak (and his mentors, Deming-influenced Peter Senge and Deming himself).\\n\\nWaraniak continued his innovations with autopilot landing technology. In 1997, he and his team installed magnetic sensors along a fifteen-mile stretch of road in San Diego. They equipped eight GM Buicks with sensing technol- ogy. Before you knew it, they had self-driving cars that would stay within their lanes for the entire stretch, like a plane being guided down a runway by land- ing beacons. While a far cry from the dream of being able to take a nap while the car drives itself, it was incredibly broad-minded. Remember, this was the era of dial-up modems and when two-way pagers were considered cutting-edge technology. Blackberries hadn’t even been invented yet. Self-driving cars, a.k.a. autonomous vehicles, started with Waraniak’s team, who had worked directly with Deming.\\n\\nSeven years later, DARPA (the military’s Defense Advanced Research Proj- ects Agency) would create the DARPA Grand Challenge, a fully autonomous race with a cash prize to the winner. In its first year, 2004, held in the Mojave Desert, the best vehicle traveled a total 7.32 miles out of the 150-mile roadway. No winner was declared. Yet the true race was on: the creation of self-driving vehicles.\\n\\nA month before the Mojave mishap, two men founded Tesla Motors in Palo Alto. A year later, Elon Musk, flush with cash from his stake of the sale of his PayPal shares, became the largest shareholder. Three years later, in 2008, Musk would force out the two founders to become CEO. The same year, Tesla’s first car, the Roadster, began to roll off the factory line. Six months later, the government loaned Tesla $465 million, part of the US government’s $8 bil- lion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. In April of 2010, Toyota was forced to close the NUMMI factory after GM reneged on their joint-venture partnership. The next month, Tesla bought it. By October, the site was producing the Tesla Model S. In 2014, Musk announced Tesla Autopi- lot, its advanced driver-assistance system.\\n\\nThe former NUMMI site also played another important role in autono- mous vehicle development. Remember the NUMMI engineer John Krafcik, who coined the term “lean”? After a successful stint at Ford and then serving as president and CEO of Hyundai Motor America, Krafcik became CEO of Goo- gle’s self-driving car program, Waymo, also a participant in the DARPA Grand\\n\\nCHAPTER 14: DEMINGMANIA\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009137\\n\\nChallenge. People from Waymo eventually left to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, such as Otto (acquired by Uber), Argo, Nuro, and Aurora, as well as the autonomous aircraft company Kittyhawk. Deming’s fingerprints are all over automobiles as we know them today and especially autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nBy the way, as this book goes to press, Waraniak is working with NATO and US Army Futures Command to transfer racing technology and processes to military vehicles to support Ukraine in its war with Russia. Deming’s methods have made a full circle, going back to his time at Aberdeen.\\n\\nThe Prophet Honored in His Own Country\\n\\nDeming’s homeland finally began to take note of what he had to say. He would eventually receive more than a dozen honorary degrees from universities, including his alma maters Yale and the University of Wyoming.\\n\\nIn 1987, President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Technology; Deming had to decline attending the event because he’d already committed to a previous client engagement. That is, Ed thought the work was more important than the accolade.\\n\\nHis daughter Diana once implored him to take his foot off the gas, so to speak. “But her efforts to get him to slow down had no effect. When she pro- tested, he told her, ‘Thank you for caring, but this is what I need to be doing. I went so many years without people really knowing what I had to say.’ ”10\\n\\nThe eighties weren’t all roses, though. His oldest daughter, Dorothy, passed away in 1984. By the late seventies, Lola had begun to develop dementia. In her final years, Ed spent countless hours caring for her and attending to her every need. She passed away in 1986.*\\n\\nThe same year Halley’s Comet came back around. Deming remembered seeing it previously\\n\\nwhen his father took him outside on the prairie to watch it arc through the night sky in 1910. This made Deming one of the few people to have experienced and be able to recall seeing the famous comet twice in their lifetime.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009138\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\nDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\\n\\nChanging a culture that has been around for hundreds of years cannot be done with words.\\n\\n—Dr. Doris Quinn\\n\\nBeing a student of Deming, I came across an untold, firsthand account of a beautiful story from one of his acolytes, a woman named Doris Quinn. It’s an unlikely tale of coincidence, friendship, and humanity that needs to be shared. In 1985, Papua New Guinea was worlds away from Ed’s life of flying first class to Fortune 500 headquarters to discuss management and statistical varia- tion. In that other world, a New Englander missionary diligently toiled away in the wilds of the country. Her message to the school-age villagers?\\n\\nGo see the witch doctor. Oddly enough, this nun (well, former nun, as she was married with two young children by the time she arrived in Papua New Guinea) would go on to become the head of quality improvement education for the world-famous MD Anderson Cancer Center and even become faculty at Vanderbilt University Medical School. Perhaps odder still, this woman would be hand-chosen by Ed to become one of his protégés. She would come to call him the Master.\\n\\nIn one of a series of strange coincidences, Doris Quinn was a nun attend- ing university to be a nurse at Rivier College in Nashua at the same time Ed was just up the road working with Bill Conway. Rivier was the first Ameri- can college to formally recognize Ed’s contributions to society as well as one the few places outside his church parish that sang his composition Mass to the Holy Ghost.\\n\\nDoris landed her first job at Portsmouth Hospital, about an hour northeast of Nashua, on the New Hampshire coast. At the time, the hospital was just beginning to use fitted sheets for patients’ beds. The new linens made cleaning patients’ rooms much faster—so much so that fitted sheets were soon every nurse’s preferred option.\\n\\nDoris learned how to game the system: she hoarded the linens. At the end of each day, she knew what her assignments were for her following shift. So, she would get fitted sheets ahead of time and tuck them away in her patients’ rooms for the next day. Her cleverness, diligence, and work ethic resulted in\\n\\nher finishing her assigned rooms much more quickly than everyone else. Her results were rewarded with a promotion.\\n\\n“Looking back, I’m ashamed,” she told me in an interview. “I thought I was doing the right thing, but really, I was simply part of an inefficient system. I optimized my little work area at the cost of optimizing the hospital’s overall quality of care. But I didn’t know better. That’s how things were back then.”\\n\\nBecause of a dearth of advanced-practice nurses, Doris found herself the recipient of a scholarship to pursue her master’s degree. She and her young family moved to Washington, DC, where she became the director of educa- tion at Sibley Memorial Hospital, which just so happened to be where Ed went for care.\\n\\nOf Magic and Men\\n\\nBut she wouldn’t meet the Master for several more years. In the meantime, she and her husband felt led to volunteer on the mission field. They trained for a year in California and then were contracted to be stationed at an aid post and school for teenage boys in Papua New Guinea. Doris would serve as a nurse, and her husband, Terry, would work on the school’s construction, the perfect combo. They arrived in 1984.\\n\\nOne of their first challenges was that no matter what they taught the teen- age boys, it wouldn’t get implemented by the villagers. All the decisions in the village were made by the older men. Young men and women had no standing whatsoever. Instead of trying to convince the elders, Doris and Terry realized they needed to first prove to the elders that they knew what they were doing. They taught their students about crop rotation, composting, and other basic agricultural practices. When it came time to harvest, the student’s corn stalks were always a bit higher, fuller, and fatter than the plots planted accord- ing to the old ways. With the success of these demonstration projects, as Doris calls them, the older villagers began to take notice.\\n\\nOne particular wrinkle in their effort to properly treat their students’ med- ical issues was the villagers’ belief in and reliance on their local magic men. Nearly exasperated trying to explain basic biology, Doris finally came up with a compromise: “Look, there are two types of illnesses. The first kind is caused by little bugs. My medicines can help with those types of illnesses. Then there’s another kind that my medicines can’t help. So, let’s make a deal. First, come to me and let me see if you’re sick with something my medicines can heal. If not, then go see the magic man to see if he can heal you.”\\n\\nFor instance, for malaria, she could treat it with chloroquine tablets. For viruses like dengue fever that can’t be treated with medicine, she would send\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009140\\n\\npatients to the magic practitioners. When they’d show back up to school, she asked if the magic man had healed them. “No,” they’d say, “but your pain meds helped!”\\n\\nWhen the family’s three-year contract ended, they opted to stay a fourth. Doris had been able to secure $25,000 in grants—enough for Terry to build the addition of a girls’ wing to the school.\\n\\nThe Spirit of Florence Nightingale\\n\\nWhen they returned to the States in 1987, Doris went back to work for the hospital in Portsmouth as the director of education. By that time, it had been purchased by the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). There, she met and began to be mentored by Dr. Paul Batalden, a person who’d become one of healthcare’s foremost voices in quality improvement (QI). After attending a QI course at corporate headquarters in Nashville, Doris fell in love with flow charts. Shortly thereafter, she became a student in a week-long statistical pro- cess control class. “A whole semester’s worth of statistics—I thought I would go crazy,” she said.\\n\\nThere, she met Charlie Ashling, a quality assurance coach for GE Aircraft in Cincinnati. He told her, “You know, you really need to do Four Days with Dem- ing. And hurry up and do it, since the man is already eighty-eight years old. I tell you what: GE is sponsoring one of these in a couple of months. You can come as my guest. That way, it’ll only cost $700 instead of $1,200. When you get there, there are two things you have to do: you have to sit up front, and you have to volunteer for the red bead experiment.”*\\n\\nDoris took him at his word. She sat in the front row and volunteered for the exercise Ed would become famous for—perhaps one of his most enduring lessons.\\n\\nThe Master taught from eight to four-thirty every day and then would go take a nap. Out of the eight hundred attendees, about a hundred stayed around for a group discussion. At about five-thirty, Ed returned to join in the ongoing conversation. One day the topic happened to be about leadership.\\n\\nDoris brought up an issue: “I’m not the CEO. I’m not even a senior leader. We talk about leadership, but how can people like me bring this teaching back to my hospital?”\\n\\nAccording to the Deming Institute, the red bead challenge uses a control chart or process\\n\\nbehavior chart to show that even if a worker is willing to do a good job, their succes is directly linked and limited by the nature of the system they are working in. Real, sustainable improve- ment is only achieved when management improves the system, starting small and then expanding out.\\n\\nCHAPTER 15: DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009141\\n\\nIn the ensuing conversation, she realized it was Papua New Guinea all over again. The “big men” weren’t going to listen to someone with no standing in the community. Instead of trying to convince them, she decided she would do more demonstration projects. She then shared this with the group, detailing what she and Terry had done with corn and dengue fever.\\n\\nAs was his usual arrangement, Ed signed books before heading off to dinner with those who’d paid for the seminar and select VIPs. As he was sign- ing Doris’s book, he looked up at her with “those steely blue eyes,” as she described them. In his deep, gruff voice, he asked, “Now, you’re the one who was in New Guinea?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” she hesitantly replied. “I did that for four years.” “Would you come to dinner with us? I’d like to hear more about that.” Wide eyed, Doris turned to the organizer of the event, Dr. Nancy Mann,*\\n\\nand asked in disbelief, “Can I do that?”\\n\\nDr. Mann made a sweeping gesture and said, “He’s the boss!” After he finished autographing everyone’s books, Deming took Doris by the hand—a gentlemanly gesture but also a necessary one, as he needed steadying from time to time—and led her into a private dining room with twelve other people. He sat Doris on his right (because that was the ear with his hearing aid), and the serving staff scrambled to set out another place setting.\\n\\nShe was incredulous:\\n\\nHere I was, a peon who hardly knew how to spell quality by this time, sitting around the table with some important people who I’m sure were wondering why I was there at all. He did ask me a lot of questions, but what I remember most about that dinner was that there was the dean of a business school sitting there. She made the grave mistake of saying to Dr. Deming, “I don’t have time to take your four-day seminar. Could we just talk about quality over dinner sometime?” Well, that’s like saying you don’t have time to study to become a surgeon, so you’ll just read the Cliff’s Notes. That was the last conversation the dean had with him that night.1\\n\\nOut of the hundreds of people who came through his seminars, why did Ed single Doris out? In 1988 and 1989, he was working on his second book\\n\\nDr. Nancy Mann worked on statistical methods in the research division of Rocketdyne, which makes rockets for the Apollo moon program. She was one of Dr. Deming’s most ardent sup- porters, going so far as to author one of the best-known books on him, The Keys to Excellence: The Deming Philosophy.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009142\\n\\nand masterwork, The New Economics, which would encapsulate the System of Profound Knowledge. One of the crucial pieces of that was an understanding of how human psychology and intrinsic motivation play a role in any type of transformation. With Doris, Ed saw someone who intuitively understood and had already put into practice what he was trying to say. He also saw a fellow philomath as well as someone who’d immersed themselves in an alien culture, fell in love with the people, and had success helping them improve their lives (reminding him, I believe, very much of himself). Remember that Deming was also a devout Christian; I’m sure he felt a kindred spirit in a missionary, but one who’d seen to the tangible needs of her flock, not just their spiritual welfare. That is, I believe Ed saw a younger version of himself as well as a brave soul he could learn from.\\n\\nProtége\\n\\nDoris had already embraced quality improvement. Deming’s seminar cemented her future career path. She returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, eager to get to work. A few months later, she received a postcard from Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. (The “coincidence” is a fine example of Ed’s sense of humor.)\\n\\nDear Doris,\\n\\nI remember how fortunate I was to make your acquaintance. It would do me good to see you. Maybe you could accompany me sometime.\\n\\nMy best wishes, W. Edwards Deming2\\n\\nWhen she eagerly replied in the affirmative, he sent a detailed letter giv- ing her directions to his New York apartment. In addition to traveling for his seminars thirty to forty weeks a year, plus regularly checking in with his ongoing clients like Nashua Corporation and Ford, he also taught at New York University and Columbia and mentored multiple graduate students. Thus, the apartment in the city that he’d kept since 1945.* By this time, the Master was eighty-nine.\\n\\nWell, he did move to a slightly safer area of Greenwich Village in 1967, but only because his\\n\\nfamily made him. Apparently, a sixty-seven-year-old man refusing to give up his wallet during a mugging and consequently getting stabbed gave Lola cause for concern.\\n\\nCHAPTER 15: DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009143\\n\\nHe arrived at his apartment at 4:30 p.m. as he said he would. He found Doris waiting for him in the lobby and gave her a big hug, saying how pleased he was to see her. In our podcast interview, she told me, “He made me feel like we’d known each other for years.” Deming turned out to be a gracious host, showing her where everything was in the small, dated studio apartment. It consisted of a kitchen, a large room with a couch and a single bed in the corner, and a bathroom.\\n\\nHe quickly shrugged off his suit coat and began getting his voicemails and returning phone calls. Afterward, he asked Doris if she minded if he took a nap. “It was dreadfully hot in the city, and I’m sure he was exhausted after teaching class for three hours.” He got a pillow for her so she could rest on the couch. But she was too excited to sleep.\\n\\nThe nap and white noise of the loud air conditioning seemed to have restored him. After asking what she’d like for dinner, they discovered they both enjoyed Thai food. The pair walked twenty minutes to one of Deming’s favorite restaurants. Since he’d gotten winded a few times walking there, she was worried about the walk back. But Deming had an added incentive to get home quickly: the promise of his favorite pastime—ice cream and Tanqueray gin.\\n\\nThus began a three-year friendship/apprenticeship that saw Doris trav- eling with Deming all over the United States, at his side not only during his four-day seminars* but also in consulting for individual companies. Moreover, he became a part of her extended family, like a favorite uncle.\\n\\nWhen working with a client, the Master started at the frontlines, talking to the workers on the factory floor. After learning from them, he’d go to their supervisors. Then came the managers. At the end of the day, he’d meet with the senior leaders. He was always kind to the workers. He was harder on the super- visors and harder still on the managers. But when it came to senior leadership, he let them have it. The Master had no qualms about letting them know what their failures were and how their thinking was fundamentally flawed.\\n\\nDoris once asked him, “Aren’t they going to be upset with you?” In his deep, gravelly voice, he answered, “They don’t pay me to sugarcoat\\n\\nthe truth.”\\n\\nShe particularly remembered the time when some mid-level managers presented him and their senior leaders with the results of a statistical process control initiative. Ed homed in on one manager in particular.\\n\\nDoris told me that these seminars often included “The Greats”: Deming’s peers such as Peter Scholtes, Brian Joiner, Bill and Laurel Scherkenbach, Ed Baker, Thomas Nolan, and William Hunter.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009144\\n\\nImagine a woman in the 1980s who manages a department at Ford Motor Company. Corporate has decided to embrace Japan’s approach to manufactur- ing. You and all the other managers in your division are required to go through a quality-control training course based on some consultant’s ideas. After taking the course, you’re supposed to come up with how to apply quality control in your department. The kicker: at the end, you have to make a presentation in front of your fellow managers to your boss, their boss, and their boss’s boss, not to mention Dr. Deming himself.\\n\\nBy this time, Ed had become larger than life for many. He’d been credited on national television as being responsible for the economic rebirth of an entire nation. His client list stretched from heavy industry—including Ford, GM, and their thousands of suppliers—all the way to cutting-edge technology—includ- ing Xerox, which had already invented laser printing, ethernet, the personal computer, and fiber optics.\\n\\nNo pressure. Doris watched as Ed grilled the woman after her presentation. She told me, “She clearly did not understand the statistics of variation. And so, the more [Dr. Deming] asked the tough questions, the more flustered she became, until it was really clear that she did not understand what Dr. Deming was asking, nor could she answer.”3 She became quite frustrated, having been embarrassed in front of her peers and superiors.\\n\\nThat evening, during Doris’s and Deming’s “gin time”—a tradition they’d kept every day since her first apartment stay—he said, “You know? I shouldn’t have been so hard on her. It’s not her fault that she didn’t know how to inter- pret special-cause and common-cause variation. That’s a failure on the part of upper management for not providing the proper training.”\\n\\nHe took several pieces of hotel stationery and drafted multiple apology letters before crafting one he thought was good enough. In it, he wrote, “I will talk to the management about the fact that you did not have enough education to do this project.”4\\n\\nThe next day, managers and executives from all over the company gathered in the auditorium ahead of Dr. Deming’s company-wide address. Doris found the woman in the audience and delivered Ed’s handwritten note. The woman was shocked.\\n\\nDespite having been awarded by the Emperor of Japan, Ed was human enough and humble enough to feel remorse for his treatment of a mid-level manager who carried little weight at his client and whom he’d probably never see again. Can you imagine Steve Jobs writing such a letter? The CEO of the global consulting firms McKinsey or Deloitte? I wouldn’t be surprised to hear of Warren Buffett doing it, but honestly, nobody would expect someone in his\\n\\nCHAPTER 15: DR.

(At least, that’s how most would view such an incident.) But that’s the kind of man Ed Deming was.\\n\\nFor a period of time, Doris worked for HCA’s corporate office in Nashville while her family remained in Portsmouth so her two sons could finish school. Upon learning she was relatively free many weekends, Deming invited her to come work for him at his home office. This is where she learned just how gen- erous the Master truly was.\\n\\nIn addition to organizing his stacks of every statistical journal imaginable, she also sorted his correspondence. She’d regularly find a letter written to the dean of some college with a note that said, “Please find a check for $15,000 enclosed to be put toward the education of your graduate student so-and-so. I would like to remain anonymous.” He and Lola (before her death) regularly supported a missionary in Japan. They also heavily supported their church, St. Paul’s Episcopal; Ed would later leave the parish a substantial portion of their wealth.\\n\\nThat isn’t to say the man was a saint. Doris recalled that whenever she accompanied him on a plane ride—always first class, as one might expect for a nonagenarian—she had to have great questions at the ready. Once, and only once, did she not have any questions prepared.\\n\\nThe Master snubbed her all the way to California. Her anecdote reminded me of something I’d read in Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon. Jeff Bezos had a similar habit: If you were going to fly with him for five hours, you’d better have five hours’ worth of questions. As Doris says of Deming, the greatest achievers are often insatiable learners.\\n\\nAt the same time Doris was crisscrossing the country with Ed or mak- ing trips to his home office at 4924 Butterworth Place, she was also pursuing her PhD in public policy while holding down her day job as HCA’s corporate director of customer knowledge and improvement (by then, one of the largest healthcare systems in the world), working closely with Dr. Batalden on hospital quality improvement. After earning her doctorate, the newly dubbed Dr. Quinn joined the faculty of Vanderbilt University Medical School, teaching quality improvement. After fifteen years there, she accepted the position of director of process improvement and quality education for MD Anderson Cancer Center, the largest cancer center in the world.\\n\\nThe number of patients whose lives Dr. Quinn has saved through her and her students’ and followers’ impact is yet another incalculable figure. Perhaps her greatest legacy, however, is as the codeveloper of the Healthcare Matrix, a method to assess patient care, which incorporates standards from the Institute\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009146\\n\\nof Medicine and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. It has already been adopted by several medical centers around the world.\\n\\nThe Doris Quinn story is yet another example of how far-reaching Dem- ing’s influence is. It’s a wonderful perspective from someone who has firsthand knowledge of how he practiced, taught, and lived. Most likely, it was Doris’s New Guinea story with the magic men that sparked this unique friendship, as it was a real-life example of the theory of psychology Deming was finalizing in 1989.\\n\\nFinal Days with Deming\\n\\n“He was a very, very driven man. He went nonstop,” Doris said to me in a pod- cast interview. “I remember one time we were in Kansas City and a reporter asked him, ‘Dr. Deming, when are you going to retire?’ The Master said, ‘Why would I want to do that?’ ‘Well, so you can do what you want,’ the reporter said. Dr. Deming looked at him and said, ‘I am doing what I want.’ ”\\n\\nBut time was taking its toll on the Master. In August of 1993, Doris received a letter from Dr. Deming asking her to accompany him for a two-day seminar in California. As was his custom at home, he’d dictated the letter to his longtime secretary, Ceil. Unbeknownst to him, Ceil had added a typewritten line of her own at the bottom: “Doris, come when you can and stay as long as you can, please get a ticket for yourself to and from Washington. We will reimburse you. DR. DEMING IS VERY ILL.”\\n\\nWhen Doris arrived a few weeks later, Dr. Deming’s usual driver picked her up from the airport. Instead of going to his home, though, they headed to her old workplace, Sibley Hospital. When she walked into the Master’s hospital room, she was shocked. Though she had seen him just three months previous, he was a ghost of his former self. Thin, frail—almost skeletal. Despite his obvi- ous pain, he told her how glad he was to see her. She noted that his smile wasn’t quite as wide as it usually was. Being the friend as well as the professional she was, Doris took it upon herself to be his personal nurse. She settled into the uncomfortable hospital recliner beside his bed for the night.\\n\\n“Every two hours, he would call me to rub his back. I believe he had pros- tate cancer that probably had metastasized in his bones. But he never spoke of his diagnosis. I would rub his bony back and he’d say, ‘Oh, dig harder. It feels better.’ I would also check his pain meds to make sure he was getting them around the clock. Obviously, we didn’t sleep much. At eight a.m., Dr. Deming looked at the clock and said, ‘Doris, get me dressed.’ I frowned and asked why. He said, ‘We have a flight at noon.’ ”\\n\\nCHAPTER 15: DR.

After seeing him safely home, Doris hugged him tight and took her leave. She cried all the way to the airport, knowing in her soul she’d seen the Master for the last time.\\n\\nOn Sunday, December 19, Deming called the executives of Ford. Instead of arriving the next day as planned, would they mind if he came on Tuesday instead? His simple explanation: “I’m tired.”\\n\\nThat Monday was indeed a day of rest for him . . . and eternally ever after. Dennis Scergent told me in a podcast that Ron Moen gave him a copy of Deming’s funeral proceedings. Turns out Deming wrote the funeral program and arranged the music.\\n\\nIn lieu of sending flowers, he directed people to donate blood.\\n\\nPART III: INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009148\\n\\nPart IV\\n\\nThe Next Generation of Profound Knowledge\\n\\nEven after his death in 1993, Deming’s influence and impact\\n\\ncontinued to grow. Many of Deming’s posthumous disciples\\n\\nwould be surprised to discover his influence in some of the most\\n\\nbleeding-edge transformations of the twenty-first century.\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nThe Digital Cambrian Explosion\\n\\nMy favorite Dr. Deming quote was his reaction to someone who was com- plaining that he had changed something in his teaching. His response was simple: “I will never apologize for learning.”\\n\\n—Doug Hall, Driving Eureka!\\n\\nInternationally acclaimed researcher and lecturer Carlota Perez examined the last two hundred years of the history of innovation and identified certain patterns over the last four technological revolutions:\\n\\n1. The Industrial Revolution, 1771–1828 2. The Age of Steam and Railways, 1829–1874 3. The Age of Steel, Electricity, and Heavy Engineering, 1875–1907 4. The Age of Oil, the Automobile, and Mass Production, 1908–1970\\n\\nIn each revolution, she points to two overarching phases, which she calls the installation and the deployment periods. In between these periods is what she terms “the turning point,” where there is a seeming explosion of innova- tion and a proliferation of new technologies. She claims we are now in the fifth technological revolution, the Age of Information, starting in 1971. This revo- lution had its turning point in 2000—a transition I call the digital Cambrian explosion.\\n\\nOver 541 million years ago, give or take, something happened. Geologists, paleontologists, and others still don’t know what exactly. They know only the results from the fossil record. Overnight (in terms of the history of the planet), life on Earth made an evolutionary leap from single-celled organisms to com- plex creatures. The scientific community is, as a rule, not given to drama and exaggeration. So, when this group of generally understated people refers to an event as an “explosion,” you know it’s no exaggeration. That’s the label they used to describe this rapid change: the Cambrian explosion.\\n\\nThis event was the one sticking point—some might say a sore spot—for Darwin in defending his theory of evolution. The difference was too stark and too fast to neatly fit into his argument. After the Cambrian explosion, all the\\n\\nfossil records seem to align with his worldview. But the event itself, he couldn’t explain. Over one hundred and fifty years later, we still can’t.\\n\\nLittle did Darwin know the technological equivalent of the Cambrian explosion—one of Perez’s turning points—was unfolding around him at the time. When On the Origin of Species was published in 1859, a little boy who lived in Port Huron, Michigan, was fascinated by telegraphy. Samuel Morse had sent the first long-distance telegraph fifteen years earlier from Baltimore to DC with the message “What hath God wrought.”* In 1859, telegraphy was state- of-the-art telecommunication. Deemed too dumb to succeed at academics by his teachers, at twelve years old the boy quit school and went to work on the railroad. At fifteen, he saved a toddler’s life from being run over by a train. A grateful father gifted the child’s savior his very own telegraph. By the next year, the young man was an apprentice telegrapher. He continued to be fascinated by the explosion of technological innovation happening at breakneck speed (for the 1800s, anyway). Before long, he’d joined the ranks of inventors and founded his own successful company based on his work.\\n\\nNot too many years behind him and only sixty miles south in Detroit, another young man was captivated by the scientific progress of the day. His fas- cination was mechanical engineering, such as steam-powered locomotives and Robert Fulton’s steamboat. In one of his own early “experiments” with steam, he destroyed one of his mother’s clay pots, resulting in being scalded and scolded. In another homemade experiment, he burned down his school’s fence. His experiments did eventually benefit the family: after seeing a steam-pow- ered vehicle, he built a steam-powered tractor for the family farm.\\n\\nThe Detroit† native would not only come to work for the telegraphy enthu- siast, but they would eventually develop a fast friendship. The two bought houses near each other, exchanged gifts, and often took camping trips together. They also did business together, going so far as to produce an electric vehicle in 1914. That’s right: we could have been driving EVs more than a century ago if circumstances had been slightly different. The friends would go down in his- tory as two of the greatest inventors and technological disruptors of all time: Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.\\n\\nWhat made these two such prolific innovators? Combinatorial play. Each of them was brilliant in his own right, but perhaps their greatest gift was their ability to combine different technologies to create wholly new ones. Edison, for example, created an enormous research laboratory where\\n\\nAlexander Graham Bell wouldn’t invent the telephone for another seventeen years. † Dearborn, technically.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009152\\n\\nthe physical technology (of his own design and others’) was readily available along with some of the brightest minds at the time at Menlo Park, New Jersey. Ford’s genius was bringing together the innovations of interchangeable parts, Adam Smith’s division of labor (from The Wealth of Nations), and his invention of the assembly line. Each of those elements by itself was good, but together they were exponentially more valuable. Edison and Ford exemplified what was happening throughout the world: people taking individual inventions, combin- ing them with other inventions, and creating whole new realms of innovation. Looking back over the progress of humanity, you probably wouldn’t have predicted this. The change was sudden and rapid, the technological equivalent of several evolutionary leaps in a single generation or even within generations of inventions. Today, though, we live in an age when these types of technolog- ical advancements are happening on a scale Edison and Ford never could have conceived of. If they thought humankind was advancing at breakneck speed, by today’s standards we’re on a bullet train, and all for the same reason: combina- torial innovation.\\n\\nWe live in the age of the digital Cambrian explosion. Thanks, in no small part, to William Edwards Deming.\\n\\nEd’s Head in the Clouds\\n\\nWhen Jeff Wilke joined Jeff Bezos at Amazon in 1999, the online book retailer grossed about $2 billion a year with a thousand employees. When Wilke retired from Amazon in 2021, Amazon grossed about $1 billion a day with a million employees. Not even Jeff Bezos himself would dispute that Wilke was largely responsible as the architect of that growth. Of Wilke, Bezos said, “I have been lucky enough to have him as my tutor. I’ve learned so much from him, and I’m not the only one. He’s been an incredible teacher to all of us.”1\\n\\nWilke’s secret to success? A culture of operational excellence—built on lean manufacturing, statistical process control, the theory of constraints, and purpose-built software.* Lean manufacturing, of course, came from the Toyota Way, the fusion of Deming’s and Japan’s “East meets West” ideas and practices. Statistical process control, too, comes straight out of the Deming handbook. The third pillar, the theory of constraints, came from Eliyahu Goldratt— himself, a self-declared devotee of Deming, as demonstrated in his paper “On the Shoulders of Giants.”2 The fourth and final piece of Wilke’s culture of oper- ational excellence (purpose-built software) suspiciously aligns perfectly with\\n\\nSee The Everything Store book for an in-depth discussion.\\n\\nCHAPTER 16: THE DIGITAL CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009153\\n\\nDeming’s first admonition in his 14 Points for Management: constancy of pur- pose toward improvement of product and service.\\n\\nWilke’s first move at Amazon was to change the model of its distribution centers. Originally modeled after Walmart’s impressive logistics, Amazon’s distribution centers couldn’t keep up with the e-commerce giant selling at scale via the internet. Wilke changed the names to “fulfillment centers” and funda- mentally changed their nature. Whereas distribution centers move wholesale products from one location to another, and then distributes those products to its retail stores, Amazon’s fulfillment centers cut out the middleman. They became warehouses that stocked products near consumers’ homes and busi- nesses so the items could be rapidly shipped.\\n\\nOf course, this meant housing millions upon millions of products in exactly the right quantities. Stock too much and the warehouse becomes inefficient while billions of dollars of inventory sit idle. Stock too little and customers become dissatisfied with slow shipping. Just the other day, I ordered an MP3 recording device at 8:00 a.m. It was at my door two hours later. We take next- day and same-day delivery from Amazon for granted today, but it takes nothing short of a digital miracle to make this happen.\\n\\nWilke hired those miracle workers. Data scientists, statistical process control experts, software engineers, and others perfected Amazon’s logisti- cal capabilities and supply-chain algorithms, and they scaled it to previously unthinkable levels. Eventually, Amazon became a distribution center for not only its own products but for other merchants as well.*\\n\\nSteve Jobs had the same problem as Jeff Bezos: his distribution network was becoming a bottleneck. Bezos brought in Wilke; Jobs brought in Tim Cook. Like Wilke, Cook’s background was in supply-chain management and industrial engineering—two topics heavily influenced by Deming.\\n\\nWhile Bezos and Jobs get all the glory, they couldn’t have accomplished what they did without a logistical genius standing right behind them—someone who understood statistical process control and lean manufacturing and could see the bigger picture of how all these systems worked together. Cook and Wilke created the backbones for the meteoric growth of their respective companies. Today, the hallmarks of the Toyota Way are a deeply integrated part of Amazon’s IT culture, from the Andon cord to continuous improvement to “go to gemba.” This enabled Bezos and Wilke to roll out the framework of what would become Amazon Web Services,† a way for organizations of any scale,\\n\\nWilke was also instrumental in creating the framework for both Amazon Prime and Alexa. † AWS, a.k.a. EC2. Cool note: I once worked with Chris Brown, the guy who wrote EC2, when I\\n\\nwas at Opscode/Chef.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009154\\n\\nfrom individual programmers to enterprise-sized companies, to rent comput- ing space from Amazon’s cloud servers.\\n\\nI’m planting my stake in the ground right here to say this was the acceler- ator of the turning point Perez predicted, the beginning of what I’ve come to call the digital Cambrian explosion. The span of time—roughly 2000 to 2010— saw an evolutionary leap and proliferation in information technology. In this time period, blue-chip companies and entire industries were being disrupted by scrappy startups and app developers. In 2000, only one of the ten largest companies in the world by market cap was involved with information technol- ogy (Microsoft). Twenty years later, tech companies made up more than half the list.\\n\\nIn Frankenstein, Mary Shelley wrote, “Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.”3 Most businesses buried their heads in the sand, even as those around them declared the end was near. Newspapers and other physical media slid further and faster into decline. Industry after industry consolidated. In every company, you could find people explaining why the disruption happening elsewhere would never happen here . . . just before someone else found a way to do just that.\\n\\nA business strategist wrote,\\n\\nUber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening.4\\n\\nUber and Airbnb owe their ability to scale to Amazon’s cloud comput- ing. The COVID-19 pandemic might have created the explosive demand for Zoom, but the video-meeting service could supply that demand only because of Amazon’s cloud services. Netflix—now the world’s largest media company, surpassing Disney, Comcast, AT&T, and ViacomCBS—purportedly spends $20 million a month renting Amazon cloud servers. Apple spends even more. Leg- acy companies like Capital One, Dow Jones, GE, McDonald’s, and Pfizer use Amazon’s cloud, as do governmental organizations like NASA and the USDA.\\n\\nBut Amazon’s cloud is only one factor in the combinatorial innovation that took off in 2006. A great example is Hadoop, an open-source software pro- gram created by a programmer at Yahoo! and named after his son’s favorite toy, a yellow elephant. Hadoop became famous after it broke a world record previously held by researchers at MIT by using Amazon’s cloud. It sorted one terabyte of data in 209 seconds, beating the researchers’ software by almost a\\n\\nCHAPTER 16: THE DIGITAL CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009155\\n\\nthird. While that’s impressive in and of itself, what’s perhaps more impressive is that Hadoop is available to anyone—not just well-funded researchers at a prestigious university. The open-source software coupled with unlimited cloud computing power meant that the everyday Joes and Janes of the world could compete on equal footing with highly advanced research labs.\\n\\nTake, for example, New York Times programmer Derek Gottfrid. In 2007, he used Hadoop and Amazon’s cloud to digitally convert eleven million articles dating from 1851 to 1922 from images into searchable text (PDFs), creating the New York Times’ TimesMachine in the process. He did this in less than twen- ty-four hours at a total cost of $240.\\n\\nGottfrid achieved this by using a hundred of Amazon’s cloud servers. If he’d done this the conventional way, he would have had to buy a hundred on-premises data servers. To get the newspaper to spring for that cost would have involved about a six-month procurement process. The direct costs would have been well over $100,000 . . . not to mention the time. Without Hadoop and Amazon’s cloud, he would have spent weeks upon weeks converting each image into text. This is a minuscule example of how a new type of combinatorial innova- tion has changed the world today—just one of hundreds, perhaps thousands of examples of how Ed’s contributions to Amazon and the greater digital Cam- brian explosion have shaped the world.\\n\\nAnother sign of how fundamentally different things had become was when Google hired its own chief economist in 2002, Hal Varian. This was an unchar- acteristic role in the private sector. Before this, chief economists worked at financial and governmental institutions. Today, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix, and even Uber have their own chief economists.\\n\\nGoogle’s Eric Schmidt was intrigued by Hal Varian’s book Information Rules, written while Varian was an economics professor at Berkeley. Varian’s presentation that I saw in 2010 solidified to me that we were in the age of the digital Cambrian explosion. He said that up until 2003, the sum of the entirety of human knowledge was equal to five exabytes* of data. (Two years later, IBM reported the world was producing 2.5 exabytes every week.) Varian predicted that by the end of the next decade, that number would multiply by over one thousand times that size, to fifty-three zettabytes.†\\n\\nIn his presentation, he introduced me to his concept of combinatorial inno- vation, a different perspective on historical technological innovation. Where\\n\\n5,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes † That’s a one followed by twenty-one zeroes. For perspective, if you had a laptop with eight gigabytes of memory, a zettabyte would be the equivalent of a trillion laptops. As far as estimates go, Varian wasn’t far off: In 2020, experts estimated we had collected forty-four zettabytes.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009156\\n\\nPerez called it a turning point, describeing it as a period of combinatorial inno- vation. Schmidt said the first wave happened when humankind began making interchangeable parts in the 1800s, as we discussed earlier with Eli Whitney’s muskets. The second wave revolved around integrated circuits in the 1950s with William Shockley. The third wave was taking place as he spoke.\\n\\nOne of the major catalysts, however, had happened about five years earlier.\\n\\nThe Development of Agile and Lean Software Development\\n\\nOn February 11, 2001, eleven tech professionals met at The Lodge, a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah. They planned to relax, have a good time, and find common ground in their shared frustrations around software development. The way the profession had been creating and delivering software code simply didn’t work. Projects were always over budget, always behind schedule, and always disap- pointing to the customer.\\n\\nExpectations were low. One of the attendees, Dr. Alistair Cockburn, said, “I personally didn’t expect that this particular group of [people] to ever agree on anything substantive.”5 To his great surprise, from this three-day meeting emerged the groundbreaking Agile Manifesto.\\n\\nYou would be hard-pressed to measure the economic and social sig- nificance of these talks and the ensuing document. The twelve principles outlined in the Manifesto, however, are primary drivers of the digital Cam- brian explosion. They resulted in agile software development, and agile is what gave us Amazon and all the other companies built on Amazon’s cloud- computing platform.\\n\\nTo hit the highlights: as part of the agile development process, teams work in short iterations to release software incrementally and iteratively so that the release process can be streamlined and the software can be released automatically.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the before-and-after reality in software development, some people use the envelope game.* There are two teams, and each team has three people. The first person on the team folds a piece of paper, the second one stuffs it in the envelope, and the third one seals the envelope.\\n\\nOne team has to work in batches of ten at a time. That is, the first person has to fold all ten pieces of paper before handing all ten over to the stuffer. The\\n\\nIn fact, the retailer Nordstrom created a popular video game version of this. The retailer was one of the first enterprise-level organizations to embrace DevOps, spearheaded by my friend Courtney Kissler.\\n\\nCHAPTER 16: THE DIGITAL CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009157\\n\\nsecond person has to put all ten pieces into their respective envelopes before turning them over to the sealer. The last person seals all ten envelopes. This represents the old approach to software development, where huge pieces of software were slowly passed from team to team, each doing their part, much the same way factory assembly lines worked under Fordism. This is sometimes described as a “waterfall process.”\\n\\nThe second team does the same thing, with one difference: instead of preparing the envelopes in batches, they used a method from the Toyota Way, called single-piece flow. As soon as the first person folds their first paper, they immediately hand it off to the next person and begin folding the second piece. The stuffer immediately stuffs the envelope and hands it off to the third per- son. While the envelope sealer is completing their task, the stuffer has already received their second piece of paper, and the paper folder is working on their third.\\n\\nOften, the second team can fold twice as many envelopes as the batch-pro- cess team in the same amount of time. This team represents agile software development, where smaller pieces of code are written and immediately passed on for the next set of steps in the process.\\n\\nIt’s called agile because the software teams are more—you guessed it— agile. Say halfway through the envelope game, the person in charge says, “You know what? You’ve all been using the wrong kind of paper. Return the unused paper and switch to this kind instead.”\\n\\nThe batch team might have already folded all ten pieces of paper and be in the middle of stuffing the envelopes; all of that work would have been wasted and all ten pieces of paper would be scrapped. The agile team, on the other hand, would have used only a portion of the first kind of paper (so the remain- der wouldn’t have to be thrown away). They could more quickly adapt to the new situation with less rework and less waste.\\n\\nThe agile team would also make more money more quickly. Say they got a dollar for every envelope they delivered. The batch team would have to wait until all the envelopes in the first batch were sealed before mailing them and making $10. The agile team, on the other hand, would make $1 within moments. They would make $10 while the first team was still stuffing envelopes and would go on to make $20 by the time the first team delivered their initial batch of ten.* Now, imagine that instead of envelopes, we were talking about develop- ing Capital One’s mobile banking app, Netflix’s streaming service, or Uber’s ride-sharing platform. The stakes are worth hundreds of millions of dollars involving thousands of people representing hundreds of thousands of labor\\n\\nGoogle “the envelope game” to watch a video for yourself.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009158\\n\\nhours. The Agile Manifesto’s impact is unfathomable. Being influenced by the Toyota Way, it is yet another example of how Deming was a catalyst of the inno- vation we enjoy today.\\n\\nAnother big driver in the digital Cambrian explosion came from a woman on the brink of retirement. She’d worked in tech for years at the innovative manufacturer 3M. Just before hanging up her spurs, she was asked to con- sult for a government software development project. She quickly encountered the same problems the authors of the Agile Manifesto did: software devel- opment was too slow, expensive, and unresponsive to be practical. So, Mary Poppendieck applied what she’d learned in lean manufacturing to coin a new methodology, showcased in her aptly named book Lean Software Development. (The key difference between Mary’s lean software development and agile was that lean development focused on waste, whereas agile focused on delivery.) For those of us in the software development industry, lean methodology was like throwing gasoline on a growing fire. Again, Mary was an intellectual descendant of Deming.\\n\\nI can’t relate the story of the digital Cambrian explosion without covering the contributions of Eric Ries. In 2004, Ries audited a class at Berkeley given by Steve Blank, author of Four Steps to Epiphany, a book drawn from many of the stories of the failed dotcoms at the end of the nineties. Ries was a quick learner and immediately implemented Blank’s ideas on customer development to technology solutions. Blank’s two biggest concepts were build, measure, learn (BML) and producing a minimal viable product (MVP). Ries’s genius was in combinatorial play—putting together BML and MVP with agile and lean meth- odologies. He blogged about his experiences, which eventually resulted in the best-selling book The Lean Startup. Today, almost every university entrepre- neur program includes his book in its curriculum. Yet again, we see the ghost of Deming hovering in the background.\\n\\nBut there was one major hurdle in software development yet to overcome:\\n\\nThe problem between the cooks in the kitchen and the waitstaff on the floor.\\n\\nDevOps and Overcoming the Great Divide\\n\\nThere is a stark difference between software operations and software develop- ment. If a tech company were a restaurant, the developers would be the cooks and operations would be the waitstaff.\\n\\nIn a poorly run restaurant, the kitchen staff are often prima donnas, who believe the entire world revolves around them. The servers are always angry at the cooks because the server gets the customers’ wrath when the order is wrong, when the steak’s overdone, or when the cook didn’t know the cilan-\\n\\nCHAPTER 16: THE DIGITAL CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009159\\n\\ntro-baked fish came with cilantro. The kitchen staff, on the other hand, gripes that the servers don’t do anything but carry food back and forth and screw up the tickets in the first place. If it weren’t for the cooks, there wouldn’t even be a restaurant.\\n\\nAnd so forth. This divide was really the last great bottleneck before the digital Cam- brian explosion was well and truly underway: There was a wall—often literally—between the people creating the software and the operations people supporting it. In 2009, John Allspaw and Greg Hammond identified this gap in a landmark presentation called “10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Coop- eration at Flickr.”* At that time, releasing a software update (or deployment) once a month was ambitious. Ten times a day? What madness was this? The two men had created what Jez Humble would later term continuous delivery (he later authored a book by the same name), describing it as a way for software development and operations to work as a seamless, transparent, integrated team. During Allspaw’s and Hammond’s presentation, I saw a tweet from fel- low attendee Andrew Clay Shafer, a software developer friend of mine. He used the hashtag #DevOps.\\n\\nWatching the presentation from afar was the Belgian programmer Patrick Debois. He, too, was sick of organizations putting development in one silo and operations in another. While at a US-based agile conference the year before, Debois had suggested an informal conversation (also known as a “birds of a feather” meeting) to discuss how the two different professions could begin to collaborate. Unfortunately, only one person signed up for the conversation— Andrew Clay Shafer. Both decided to blow off the “birds of a feather” meet up.† Allspaw’s and Hammond’s presentation was the proof and final push Debois needed. He created an event in Ghent, Belgium, later that year called DevOps Days. About fifty tech professionals came from the UK and other parts of Europe. I was the lone American.\\n\\nAt the time, I was working for a company called Chef, which automated coding that allowed system administrators to create thousands of data servers in the time it usually took them to build one. The CEO, Jesse Robbins (whose official title while at Amazon had been Master of Disaster), handed me a credit card and told me to figure out what this DevOps thing was. At this point in my career, I’d been programming for thirty years. I was naively certain I’d seen it all. Sure, I was excited about the promise of DevOps, but my expectations in no way prepared me for what I encountered in the stories of my European\\n\\nThis was four years after the video- and image-sharing social media platform had been\\n\\nacquired by Yahoo.\\n\\n† Ironically, the birth of DevOps was a meeting that never happened.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009160\\n\\ncounterparts at the world’s first DevOps Days. Young women and men related unbelievable implementations of code at a level of automation, speed, and scale unprecedented anywhere in the world—not at three-person tech start- ups but by global banks, huge insurance companies, and national healthcare organizations. It seems Allspaw’s and Hammond’s experience was not a fluke unique to Flickr but could be replicated by all sorts of development and oper- ations teams.\\n\\nAfter Ghent, Debois posted, “I’ll be honest, for the past few years, when I went to some of the Agile conferences, it felt like preaching in the desert. I was kinda giving up, maybe the idea was too crazy: developers and ops working together. But now, oh boy, the fire is really spreading.”6\\n\\nWhen I got home, I convinced my friend Damon Edwards that we had to have a DevOps Days in the US immediately. A few months later, in June of 2010, we ran the first US conference at LinkedIn’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. Three hundred people attended. Whatever I felt at Ghent was dwarfed by Mountain View. The sheer potential in time savings, agility, pro- ductivity, and opportunities was staggering. There was no doubt in my mind that DevOps was the final piece of the digital Cambrian explosion.\\n\\nDamon and I tried to codify what DevOps meant and came up with the acronym CAMS: culture, automation, measurement, and sharing. Jez Humble would later add an L for “lean,” resulting in CALMS. The main ideas emerging from this movement were heavily influenced by the Agile Manifesto and Lean Software Development. However, DevOps added two significant components: collaboration between developers and operations and explicit examples of how to automate both agile and lean principles.\\n\\nOf course, you can’t tell the story of DevOps without talking about Gene Kim. When Gene attended DevOps Days in Mountain View, he was already a legend in my crowd (operations professionals). Something of a prodigy, he was a UNIX systems administrator for Sun Microsystems while still in high school. He was there when one of the first computer viruses in the world, the Morris Worm, took out 10% of the thirty thousand servers that were connected to the internet. After graduating from Purdue, Gene and a former professor named George Spafford launched Tripwire, an early and quite successful cybersecurity company. What cemented Gene’s reputation was probably his 2005 book The Visible Ops Handbook, based on research by Gene, George, and Kevin Behr, where they found that 80% of IT outages were self-inflicted.*\\n\\nAt Mountain View, Gene took the opportunity to find and meet John Allspaw. Before Gene could even say hello, John whipped out a coffee-stained, dog-eared book he kept in his back- pack: Visible Ops. He handed it to Gene to sign for him. John had no idea Gene would be there; he just happened to have the book with him. True story.\\n\\nCHAPTER 16: THE DIGITAL CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009161\\n\\nEven after Mountain View, Gene was still a little suspicious about the whole DevOps concept. We agreed to meet up at South by Southwest a few months later. There, I tried to lay out the beauty and potential of DevOps as well as I could. “Think of it this way: DevOps is a lighthouse bringing all of us ops and sys-admins* lost at sea back home.” I think that did the trick.\\n\\nGene began to discuss a book he, George, and Kevin had been working on for five years. It was a modern retelling of the bestselling business book The Goal, a novel about supply-chain management in a manufacturing setting. These three men gave it a modern lens: a novel about software development and delivery. They called it The Phoenix Project. (He included DevOps in the subtitle, I might proudly add.)\\n\\nIn discussing the book, Gene and I realized that people would want a pre- scriptive solution after reading it. A few years before it was published, Gene, Patrick Debois, and I began working on what would become The DevOps Hand- book. Jez Humble joined us and we published the book in 2016. The books have sold almost a million copies combined.\\n\\nAround 2014, I had seen a DevOps presentation at a local DevOps Days event in Minneapolis featuring Target’s respective heads of operations and development, Ross Clanton and Heather Mickman. Their presentation reminded me of John’s and Greg’s Flickr presentation, but this was on a retail enterprise scale, quite different from a tech company. For a few years, corpo- rate naysayers—including the Big Five (Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers)—refused to believe DevOps could work as-is in an enterprise setting. They discussed how to run a gentler, less aggressive/ ambitious version in a corporate environment. I knew this wasn’t the case, but how could we show everyone else? Target wasn’t an isolated case. I’d also met Courtney Kissler at Nordstrom doing some incredible things with DevOps without compromising any part of its principles.\\n\\nGene, Damon Edwards, and I discussed the need for a showcase event; Gene decided to put together the DevOps Enterprise Summit in 2014. We put out requests for proposals and the response was overwhelming. Over six hun- dred people attended with presenters from not only Target and Nordstrom but also Nationwide, Macy’s, Huawei, PNC Bank, Ticketmaster, and MITRE, as well as the CIO of US Citizenship and Immigration Services and even representa- tives from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (with roots going back to the thirteenth century).\\n\\nToday, there’s not a major company on the planet that isn’t discussing DevOps.

It’s been mainstream in the Fortune 500 since 2018. It is the human capital piece of the Digital Cambrian Explosion.\\n\\nAs far back as 2012, my friend and mentor Ben Rockwood suggested I read Deming’s 14 Points for Management if I really wanted to understand the roots of DevOps. Once I did, it was clear to me that most of what I knew about this movement had already been codified over forty years before. Reading Deming, I realized how powerful his ideas were on cooperation and human potential. At that point, I became focused (some might say obsessed) on learning and shar- ing more about Dr. Deming and how his ideas related to the digital Cambrian explosion.\\n\\nToday, my all-time most requested presentation? “Deming to DevOps.”\\n\\nCHAPTER 16: THE DIGITAL CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009163\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\nWhat Would Deming Do?\\n\\nA common disease that afflicts management and government administra- tion the world over is the impression that “Our problems are different.” They are different, to be sure, but the principles that will help to improve quality of product and of service are universal in nature.\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming, Out of the Crisis\\n\\nOver his lifetime, Ed eventually codified his system of systems and named it the System of Profound Knowledge. In Deming’s masterwork, The New Eco- nomics, published in 1993, the Master simplified his 14 Points for Management into the four elements of the System of Profound Knowledge:\\n\\n1. The Theory of Knowledge: a theory for knowing how you know something 2. The Theory of Variation: a theory of how to measure what you know 3. The Theory of Psychology: a theory of how to understand human\\n\\nbehavior\\n\\n4. Appreciation of Systems and Systems Thinking: an understanding of\\n\\ninterconnectedness\\n\\nUpon learning he named it “profound,” many people (myself included) ini- tially think, Whoa, that’s a bit cocky! But the more you learn about Ed, the more you realize how humble, how soft spoken he was and how he readily gave credit where credit was due. In his books, it seems like there’s a footnote on nearly every page where he thanks someone for an idea, an insight, or just the inspira- tion for the topic. His correspondence with people from all over the world, from economists to politicians to philosophers, now housed in the Library of Con- gress, show his insatiable appetite as a willing student looking to learn from others. Only in studying him more carefully to write this book did I come to understand what he really meant by “profound.”\\n\\nTo profoundly change a system, whether that be how you manufacture a product or how we educate students, requires know-how outside of that sys- tem. If the system had that knowledge, then it would change itself on its own. That’s why managers often bring in high-priced consultants: they know their\\n\\nbusiness has a problem, but they’re too close to the problem to see it. It requires someone from the outside to step in.\\n\\nBut the beauty of Ed’s System of Profound Knowledge is that it doesn’t require someone from the outside. It provides a way for the owners of a sys- tem to bring about their own profound change, no third parties required. But why did Ed use the metaphor of a lens to describe the System of Profound Knowledge?\\n\\nThe Perfect Picture\\n\\nIt was indeed an iconic photograph, yet Greta never knew who kissed her.\\n\\nGermany had already surrendered, but the war in the Pacific had dragged on. Even after the first atomic bomb had dropped on Hiroshima, the Japanese kept fighting. Both sides knew an Allied victory was a foregone conclusion, but the last remaining Axis power was determined to fight to the bitter end. Both sides prepared for a lengthy—and costly—invasion of the Japanese islands.\\n\\nBut on August 15, 1942, the twenty-one-year-old dental assistant in Man- hattan began to hear rumors flying around the office that Emperor Hirohito had formally surrendered. If it were true, it would mean the war was finally over! As soon as work was finished at five, she dashed out the door and headed a few blocks over to Times Square, still in her stark white uniform.\\n\\nIt was true! Victory in Japan! People in the streets were jubilant. I imagine it was especially moving for Greta. You see, both of her parents died in the Holocaust. At just fifteen years old, the young Jewish woman, along with her two younger sisters, had fled from Austria to the US to escape persecution. The war that had defined her life was finally over. Out of nowhere, a sailor bent her over backward and kissed her squarely on the mouth. Later, she’d recall,\\n\\nit wasn’t that much of a kiss, it was more of a jubilant act that he didn’t have to go back, I found out later. He was so happy that he did not have to go back to the Pacific where they already had been through the war. And the reason he grabbed someone dressed like a nurse was that he just felt very grateful to nurses who took care of the wounded . . . it wasn’t a romantic event. It was just an event of “thank God the war is over” kind of thing.1\\n\\nLittle did she know at the time that the black-and-white photograph of “The Kissing Sailor”* in Times Square would go down in American history as\\n\\nGreta would later come to have mixed feelings about the forced kiss. It was in no way consen-\\n\\nsual, and she never would agree to a reenactment.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009166\\n\\none of the most famous photographs ever.* One picture that summed up the feelings of the entire nation (or perhaps even the world), now that the bloody conflict was behind them. That’s the magic of great photographs: They some- how capture all of those emotions, thoughts, history, and hopes into a single instance.\\n\\nFrom Complexity to Clarity\\n\\nThere are three factors to a great photograph: light, depth, and motion. Pho- tographers call these the exposure triangle. More technically, they are the sensitivity to light, aperture, and shutter speed. All three have to be “tuned” just right to result in a great photo. The light was just right to capture the stark white uniform contrasted against the dark blue of the sailor’s uniform (well, black, since it was a black-and-white photograph). The photographer focused the depth of the camera perfectly and had his shutter speed set just right. If any one of those factors hadn’t been exactly as they needed to be, the world would never have had the swelling emotions of an entire nation distilled into an iconic picture like this. All three elements have to work in unison to turn a complex series of events into one crystal-clear moment.\\n\\nWhen trying to transform people, organizations, and even governments, the System of Profound Knowledge is very much the same: you have to expertly balance multiple elements in order to see a perfect picture through the lens. In the case of Deming’s system, there are four. Without all four, the route to profound change or transformation isn’t clear.\\n\\nThe first element, the theory of knowledge, essentially asks, “How do you know what you know?” Whereas people often react to problems with knee-jerk reactions and helter-skelter decisions, Deming saw that every action should be grounded in tangible evidence, i.e., the philosophy of pragmatism. Life itself is too complex for any one person to understand. Therefore, a person can’t rely only on what they think—they have to test it before they can truly know something. Think back to the cost savings of a nine. 99.99% uptime sounds great . . . but is it practical? Is there an economic limit to the improvement? Deming gave us an evolved version of the Shewhart cycle, the PDSA loop, as a way to apply the scientific method to acquire knowledge on any topic.\\n\\nDeming saw the second element, variation, as a force of nature, a natural law that couldn’t be avoided, such as the variation of the punch card opera- tors inputting data for the Census: Perfection was impossible. The goal, then,\\n\\nLike Rosie’s, Greta’s photograph would be credited to another woman for years before she was\\n\\nrecognized as the original subject.\\n\\nCHAPTER 17: WHAT WOULD DEMING DO?\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009167\\n\\nshould be to understand variation and, more importantly, to differentiate between the two types of variation. One kind is predictable and can be planned for. The other kind can’t be predicted. Sometimes it can be addressed, but some events are “black swans,” freak occurrences that may never happen again. The key is understanding the difference between the two so that managers don’t waste time trying to correct the wrong things. Remember, misunderstanding variation is the root of all evil.\\n\\nThird, Deming was a student of human behavior and psychology. In fact, Doris Quinn told me that in the four-day seminars she assisted him with, perhaps only 20% was devoted to variation and statistical process control. He spent most of his time talking about managing people and leadership.\\n\\nAs I noted, I believe that Deming saw Doris’s story about dengue fever as a prime example of how to work with human psychology instead of against it. But ever since Hawthorne, he’d been mulling over the differences in manage- ment styles: Taylorism, which assumed workers would put forth the minimum effort possible, versus the kind of intrinsic motivation he lived, believed in, and saw in full force in Japanese companies.\\n\\nAt Hawthorne, he recognized that improving a system was determined by the efforts of the people within that system—that human beings were an integral part of the process, not a gear to be swapped out at the change of each working shift. More than that, he came to recognize that those workers could be a wealth of ideas and insights on how to improve the system. He came to have a profound respect for the contributions of individuals working in a pro- cess. Instead of dismissing or minimizing the human element, as Fordism and Taylorism did, his approach elevated it, putting it front and center.\\n\\nThe fourth element is the knowledge of systems thinking. Few people intuitively think in terms of a system; Deming was one of them. Deming would refer to this as an appreciation of a system. To him, seeing the world as a net- work of interconnected systems was as natural as gravity: regardless of your perspective or understanding, it was a fact of life. The world working in sys- tems wasn’t a theory for him; it simply was.\\n\\nMost people can see only the problem in front of them. The Master, on the other hand, could “see” the factors, elements, and variables that contributed to it. He saw how everything worked together, how the factors of a problem came into existence several steps ago. For Deming, the method was more important than the outcome, like how Sakichi Toyoda prioritized improving his machines over simply building as many as possible, or how Paul O’Neill prioritized safety, which naturally resulted in higher-quality operations. Get the process right and you’ll naturally get the right results. Put another way: don’t optimize the com- ponents of a process—optimize the process itself.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009168\\n\\nBefore you can make something better, you have to understand it. Deming said you can’t understand something completely unless you’re looking through the lens of all four elements. I think of it like the story about the blind men who encountered an elephant but could identify it only by feel. One man felt the tail and declared the unknown entity was a rope. Another man felt the elephant’s ear and confidently said it was a frond fan. The third blind man felt its leg and asserted the thing was a tree. The last man felt the trunk and quickly drew his hand back, fearful of the big snake he’d laid his hands on. Without someone there with a broader perspective, the four men were each convinced they alone had the answer and that the other three were mistaken. Without all four ele- ments of the System of Profound Knowledge, there is no profound knowledge; there’s only what each person is able to see.\\n\\nLet’s use Profound Knowledge to understand a profound problem. One costing ten million dollars a minute.\\n\\nHow to Lose Millions in a Microsecond\\n\\nWhen someone mentions Wall Street or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we usually picture Gordon Gekko types directing people on the floor of the chaotic exchange, shouting orders to buy and sell stocks. Digital ticker tapes continuously scroll with the latest stock prices. Computer screens abound; papers are strewn everywhere.\\n\\nWhile the NYSE still maintains its trading floor, the vast majority of stock trades happen in a quiet building across the Hudson River in Mahwah, New Jersey. This datacenter thirty miles west of Manhattan is the true heart of Wall Street these days.\\n\\nWhen the financial firm Knight Capital was founded in 1995, most trades still happened on the floor. If you traded with Merrill Lynch, the firm had a trader physically stationed on the floor who would buy and sell stocks. Toward the late nineties, however, the founders of Knight Capital noticed the trend of more and more stock trades happening electronically based on computer algo- rithms. This trend accelerated when an antitrust lawsuit against the NYSE and NASDAQ mandated those stock exchanges to accept orders that used integrated electronic communication networks. This led to what’s called high-frequency trading (HFT), where computer programs buy and sell stocks based on specific parameters at lightning-fast speeds.\\n\\nIn 2002, the new CEO of Knight Capital, Thomas Joyce, decided to shift the firm’s focus to high-volume market making enabled by HFTs. “Market making” is where an entity (be it a company or individual) makes money on the difference between the selling price of a stock (the “ask”) and its buying price (the “bid”).\\n\\nCHAPTER 17: WHAT WOULD DEMING DO?\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009169\\n\\nLet’s say the market ask for Tesla is $335.33. That’s the price the people and firms who currently own Musk’s stock are willing to sell their shares for. The people and firms who want to buy Tesla stock are willing to pay $335.36 per share. Knight Capital would buy the stock at $335.33, then turn around and sell it to others for $335.36. They would make $0.03 profit per share. That doesn’t sound like much until you know that at its height, Knight Capital traded 3.97 billion shares a day.\\n\\nUnder Joyce, Knight Capital became the stock market equivalent of a wholesaler. It targeted large-volume dealers, such as hedge funds, institutional investors, and electronic discount brokers like E*Trade, DT Ameritrade, and Vanguard. By 2011, it was worth $1.5 billion, trading approximately 17% of the NYSE and NASDAQ each, and employed 1,450 people around the world.\\n\\nMuch of this was done on the NYSE’s “dark trading pools.” These private electronic exchanges operated outside of the normal channels yet were often housed in the NYSE’s datacenter. Their purpose was to make it easier to con- duct computer-generated trading.\\n\\nIf this seems a bit shady, read Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis. It tells the story of Brad Katsuyama, a day trader who managed a Royal Bank of Canada hedge fund. Katsuyama acted as a middleman between insti- tutional investors (like the Royal Bank of Canada) and the public market. Say there were five million shares of Tesla available. Market demand at the moment is for only three million shares. Katsuyama could buy five million shares at a good price, immediately sell the three million shares demanded, then hold the other two million to sell a few minutes or hours later.\\n\\nIn 2007, Katsuyama started noticing a problem: By the time he could hit the buttons on his computer screen in Manhattan to buy some stocks, the price and volume available had already changed. His computer might take five milli- seconds to execute a trade. That’s five-thousandths of a second. It’s hard for the human brain to even comprehend that tiny amount of time. The dark trading pools, however, could execute trades in about five microseconds. That’s five millionths of a second.\\n\\nThe problem: Katsuyama’s computer was too far away from Mahwah. A dark trading pool could buy and sell shares, then buy and sell them again before Katsuyama even finished pressing “Enter.”\\n\\nAnother advantage the NYSE’s dark trading pools had over their human competitors: they were allowed to buy and sell shares on margins of just a frac- tion of a cent. That is, computers could buy Tesla shares at $335.331 and sell them at $335.336, making a half-cent profit. Again, that doesn’t sound like much until you remember we’re talking about billions of trades per day. Knight\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009170\\n\\nCapital made money hand over fist for years . . . until one fateful forty-five minutes on August 1, 2012.\\n\\nAbout a year before, the NYSE decided to develop a service called the Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) to make trading fairer for retail investors. In June of 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved it. The stock exchange planned to roll it out in August.\\n\\nThomas Joyce couldn’t decide if he wanted his firm to participate in the RLP or not. He’d spent the entire previous year on the fence, citing concerns. Once the SEC approved it, he changed his mind, saying not only that his firm would participate but that they’d be ready come August. This gave his tech developers just thirty days to ready their systems to be integrated with the RLP. I’ve been a programmer for over forty years, and I can tell you, thirty days on a project of this magnitude is ambitious, even for an agile organization . . . and Wall Street firms in 2012 were anything but agile. RLP went live at 9:30 a.m. on August 1. Forty-five minutes later, Knight Capital went bust. In that short amount of time, the firm lost $460 million dollars—more than ten million dollars every minute. The next day, its stock price plummeted 75%. The next week, 70% of the company had to be sold just to stay solvent. The next year, the one-time king of Wall Street merged with an electronic trad- ing company out of Chicago.\\n\\nWhat the hell happened? While we’ll probably never know exactly what\\n\\ntranspired, what follows is what I’ve been able to piece together.\\n\\nSo, so many things went wrong. For the purposes of this story, let’s start with Knight Capital’s order router. Basically, stock trades would hit the sys- tem and the router would route each order to one of its eight software servers. All eight servers had an old piece of testing software called Power Peg. You’ve heard the secret to making money is to buy low and sell high? Power Peg did the opposite of that. But that would have been okay because the software was never meant to be used in real life. It was originally built to test Knight Capital’s proprietary trading algorithms in a controlled environment. Although it hadn’t been used since 2003, Power Peg had been left sitting on the servers with its digital switch* in the “off” position. You can see where this is going. For some unfathomable reason, Knight Capital’s developers reused Power Peg’s digital “on-off” switch. On top of that, they installed their new RLP-com- pliant code on only seven of the eight servers. Oops.\\n\\nTechnically, a binary flag.\\n\\nCHAPTER 17: WHAT WOULD DEMING DO?\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009171\\n\\nWhen 9:30 a.m. hit, the system began receiving trading orders. The router routed the trades to the eight different servers. The first seven performed as expected. The eighth, however, was running Power Peg. Buy high and sell low? Why, the opportunities for the code to do its job were practically endless!\\n\\nThere were supposed to be internal safeguards for this kind of out-of- control computer. The new RLP code included programs to check for excessive activity. However, those programs overlooked Power Peg’s trades because Power Peg was never supposed to run live in the first place.\\n\\nThere were also supposed to be external safeguards. Two years earlier, a software glitch caused the Dow Jones to lose about 9% of its value in the space of just thirty-six minutes, known as the Flash Crash. To prevent this from happening in the future, the SEC mandated electronic stock exchanges install “circuit breakers.” These would “trip” and halt all trading if the market changed more than 10% in five minutes. This is another example of the potential for systems thinking. Did it not cross anyone’s mind that if prices could spike, volumes could too? Nobody thought to also install circuit breakers for violent swings in trading volumes because that was never supposed to happen. So, when the NYSE trading volume suddenly doubled, there was nothing to stop Power Peg from continuing on. (Kind of like killing mosquitoes with DDT in Borneo.) A software engineer at the NYSE noticed something was wrong and imme- diately tried to contact the CEO. Joyce, however, was undergoing knee surgery at the time. The engineer tried person after person before finally landing on the phone with Knight Capital’s CIO. All in all, it took the firm about twenty minutes from the time things went wrong until they attempted to remediate the issue. The software developers immediately uninstalled the new RLP code on the seven servers. (This is referred to as a “rollback.”) However, they forgot that they had reused Power Peg’s on-off switch. The result: Power Peg was suddenly running on all eight servers—thousands of orders representing millions of stock worth billions of dollars. After forty-five minutes, they were finally able to shut their entire trading system off, but it was too late.\\n\\nWho’s to blame? Should we blame the developers for reusing Power Peg’s switch? For forget- ting to copy the RLP code to the eighth server? For forgetting to turn the switch to Off before uninstalling the RLP code? Maybe it’s the SEC’s fault for not prop- erly safeguarding the market as a whole. Maybe it’s the CEO’s fault for waiting until the last minute to go ahead with a massive software change.\\n\\nDeming told managers that only 6% of problems were due to human error; 94% of problems were due to system error. And since the system is the respon- sibility of management, he meant that 94% of problems are caused by bad\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009172\\n\\nmanagement. Let’s look at the Knight Capital software incident through the lens of Profound Knowledge.\\n\\n(Note: These observations should be considered counterfactuals. Not the facts themselves, but my interpretation and surmising, given the second- and third-hand information available. This is strictly a thought exercise and should by no means be construed as a true case study.)\\n\\nA Theory for Knowledge\\n\\nIn the SEC investigation, Knight Capital couldn’t demonstrate that it had per- formed adequate software testing. That is, according to the SEC, the developers thought the code would work, but they couldn’t prove they had tested their theory. It wasn’t clear that they could demonstrate to the SEC that they had any evidence to tell them that what they believed was, in fact, correct.\\n\\nA good software product team should instill a software development cul- ture that being wrong is a good thing; that’s how organizations learn. Without learning, an organization dies. A tool for learning is the PDSA loop, and it’s an essential part of testing software code these days. In most organizations, they Plan and Do. However, they miss the Study and Act portions of the cycle. If you never evaluate and refocus your efforts, how can you know that things are headed in the right direction? Like Steven Spear describing the Toyota environ- ment as a community of scientists in The High-Velocity Edge, an organization that only Plans and Does can never really improve.\\n\\nA Theory of Variation\\n\\nIt appears no one at Knight Capital truly understood variation. If they did, it certainly wasn’t reflected in their business practices. I’ve spoken to a number of IT professionals at high-frequency traders like Knight Capital. They all say that a glitch like Power Peg could happen. Few think it would have taken forty-five minutes to stop. Why? Because they watch for common- and special-cause vari- ation. As a matter of fact, observing variation in high-scale IT operations is a common practice.\\n\\nFor example, I was once at a seminar where Amazon’s CTO, Werner Vogels, was asked about the company’s monitoring system. He said Amazon monitors many things, but the company cares about only one thing: the order rate. From years of data and records, Amazon’s software could tell common-cause varia- tion apart from special-cause. If the order rate was relatively high on a Saturday afternoon in December but fell within their upper and lower control limits, then\\n\\nCHAPTER 17: WHAT WOULD DEMING DO?\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009173\\n\\neverything was fine. However, if the order rate suddenly displayed a pattern— like the example of the steadily rising home temperature readings from my iPhone app—even if it was within the control limits, Amazon’s systems would not only alert them but activate safeguards in place to prevent catastrophe.\\n\\nAt the very least, nearly all high-frequency traders have a “kill switch.” Where was Knight Capital’s? The fact that they attempted a rollback—a classic knee-jerk reaction—instead of simply stopping electronic trading leads me to believe they didn’t have a kill switch in the first place.\\n\\nA Theory of Psychology\\n\\nAs I’ve already noted, the financial world isn’t exactly known for cultivating an empathetic, trusting, transparent, collaborative type of culture. Based on the post-incident analysis of the debacle, Knight Capital doesn’t seem to be any different. For example, a hallmark of cooperation and trust within product and development teams is the peer-review process. In the SEC’s opinion, the firm didn’t seem to have anything of the sort. Review methods might include informal walkthroughs, pair programming, and formal reviews. These types of collaborative code reviews foster trust and improve the overall quality of the product.\\n\\nI once did a consulting engagement at a major high-frequency trader and was told a story about one code review process they had. Whenever changing the software on one of their trading applications, they would pair a software developer with an actual trader. Sitting side-by-side during one particular review, the developer noticed the trader didn’t use a button on the screen, opt- ing instead to perform the function manually. He asked the trader why she didn’t use the button, as it would save her several keystrokes. She replied the button was hard to see, and she’d gotten used to her workaround anyway. While sitting there, the developer changed the code to move the button to a more con- venient place and changed it to a more vivid color. The trader said, “Oh, that’s perfect! I’ll use this from now on.”\\n\\nDid this type of thing ever happen at Knight Capital? Another issue I’ll point out is that there probably wasn’t a culture of psy- chological safety. In a psychologically safe environment, a team encourages negative feedback and pushback when someone has an issue and feels safe that they won’t be punished for speaking up. Every team member should have the assurance that they can pull the metaphorical Andon cord at any time without repercussion. Does it sound like the CEO’s rush-order directive for the RLP sys- tem enabled that kind of environment?\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009174\\n\\nSystems Thinking\\n\\nDeming said it is management’s responsibility to create a clear vision for a system. The CEO waffled on his decision to integrate with the RLP until the proverbial eleventh hour. That’s the opposite of a clear vision and clear com- munication. On the part of the NYSE, once they realized the SEC was taking its time approving their program, they could have moved the rollout date to weeks or even a couple of months later.\\n\\nYou might think the software developers realized how much of a challenge they’d been tasked with. Did management listen to their concerns? That is, did the culture exist for the developers to voice their misgivings to begin with? It would be easy for me to believe that a powerful Wall Street financial firm had a top-down, high-pressure, dog-eat-dog kind of culture. In these environments, people quickly learn not to challenge their managers. They keep their heads down and hope for the best.\\n\\nOne could argue the SEC should have never approved Knight Capital’s par- ticipation in the RLP, as the firm had failed its annual CEO certification with the SEC earlier that year. As such, Knight Capital’s risk-management controls and supervisory procedures were not documented. This and other SEC viola- tions should have been red flags for everyone involved.\\n\\nIn an SEC investigation* of the incident, the firm failed to provide:\\n\\nan adequate written description of its risk-management controls as\\n\\npart of its books and records\\n\\ntechnology governance controls and supervisory procedures suffi- cient to ensure an orderly installation of new code nor to prevent the activation of code no longer intended for use\\n\\ncontrols and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to guide employ-\\n\\nees’ responses to significant technological and compliance incidents\\n\\na process in place to adequately review its business activity in connec- tion with its market access to assure the overall effectiveness of its risk management controls and supervisory procedures\\n\\na second technician to review the code installation (a.k.a. a peer review) • a written procedure requiring such a review\\n\\nTo contrast an SEC investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigations we discussed in Captain Sully’s story: The NTSB gathers information to determine probable cause and then issues a report. The SEC, on the other hand, gathers information to obtain evidence so they can file a claim in federal court.\\n\\nCHAPTER 17: WHAT WOULD DEMING DO?\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009175\\n\\nA peer review is basic common sense. We have proofreaders because it’s hard to catch our own writing mistakes. How much more difficult is it to catch our own coding mistakes? Every regulatory compliance framework I’m aware of requires peer review, from processing credit cards (the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS) to storing patients’ medical records (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA). Even the US military has to do peer reviews as mandated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Lola Deming’s erstwhile employer).\\n\\nIt appears there may have been a failure in the basic function of leader- ship. Setting aside the question of why the CEO would schedule knee surgery during the morning of such a significant event: Did Knight Capital have some emergency process in place? Why didn’t he forward his calls to someone in his office? Why did it take so much time for the NYSE to get someone from the firm on the phone in the first place? When the CIO finally learned of the prob- lem, was there a contingency plan in place? It was general mayhem while the company tried to figure out how to fix the problem. When they did react, they uninstalled the software in what’s called a rollback. Rollbacks have to be done in a meticulous way or you wind up with situations like this. Did management consider simply halting trading altogether?\\n\\nThese types of cause-and-effect dominoes are exactly what Deming meant when he admonished managers to grasp systems thinking. You can’t look at problems in isolation; everything is connected to everything else.\\n\\nWe’ll probably never know what the real facts were behind Knight Capital’s operations and the SEC’s cease-and-desist order. However, looking at it from Dr. Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge perspective, these are certainly a number of questions he would have posed.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009176\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\nDeming’s Dark Legacy\\n\\nThe illiterate of the future will not be the person who cannot read. It will be the person who does not know how to learn.\\n\\n—Alvin Toffler\\n\\nJust around the time Dr. Deming began working with Doris to pull together his last book, the term cybersecurity began to gain traction in 1987 with the birth of the first commercial antivirus software. One of the most notable was invented by John McAfee; you’ve probably seen McAfee VirusScan on a desk- top somewhere. As Deming passed in 1993, he didn’t have the opportunity to assess, much less pontificate, on the issue that has become a serious threat over the past thirty years.\\n\\nDeming’s teachings led to the Toyota Way, which led to lean manufactur- ing. Lean gave rise to lean and agile software development, leading to DevOps, resulting in the Digital Cambrian Explosion. Deming is part and parcel of software today—even the dark side. Today, there are a few of us who realize that his ideas are also the antidote to the software viruses plaguing the twen- ty-first century. To appreciate the scope and scale of this plague, let’s look at the landscape we’re facing.\\n\\nHow to Rob a Bank\\n\\nEver watch a documentary where they hide the identity of an interviewee? The person sits in a dark room, their face especially shadowed, and their voice is distorted, making them sound like an evil robot.\\n\\nThat was the person on the other end of my virtual meeting screen. Both the video and audio were garbled to protect my interviewee’s identity, as well as my own. He wasn’t in witness protection. Quite the opposite: He was a bad guy shielding his identity from the rest of us at the cybersecurity conference. Though he was a hacker, he hadn’t hacked his way into the conference. In fact, he was an invited guest. He sat in an undisclosed location on site, available to be interviewed by anyone interested in learning how those who had turned to the dark side operated. Since much of my work these days is consulting for large financial institutions, I was especially interested in how he’d hacked a bank. As it turns out, it was depressingly easy.\\n\\nIt’s much harder to hack a bank from the outside than from the inside, as most organizations spend much more money protecting their network from external attacks than internal sabotage. So, his goal was to get inside the corpo- rate network so he could hack their servers via their own network. He’d start by finding the location of the corporate IT center. Then, he’d start hanging around the coffee shops and lunch spots in the area. He’d eavesdrop until he found a group of employees who worked at the IT center. It was amazing how much he could learn by simply listening to their lunchtime conversations.\\n\\nThen, he’d discreetly follow them to learn how they entered the building. Most entry points require an employee badge, but there are often additional access points that don’t, such as maintenance doors or fire escapes. Employees aren’t supposed to use those doors, but they do anyway. It saves them time from having to walk all the way around to the front.\\n\\nOne day, he dressed up like the typical employee, then followed a group heading back from lunch. Just as the last person was going through the door, he called out, “Hey, would you hold the door, please!” Just like that, he was in. Once inside, he casually walked around until he found an empty and obvi- ously unused cubicle away from everyone else. He pulled out a small computer called a Raspberry Pi. (You can get them on Amazon for about $100.) Then, he began electronically sniffing around for vulnerabilities in the corporation’s net- work. Once he found his way onto their internal network, he hid the Raspberry Pi. Even if it were found, it wouldn’t look conspicuously out of place. Then he walked out of the building. Once home, he would simply connect via the inter- net to the Raspberry (serving as a network proxy), and he was in.\\n\\nSurprisingly, many large banks I work with still think that, as long as they protect what’s called the network perimeter, their systems are safe. When I ask my clients why a certain system isn’t better protected, they reply that it’s not customer- or internet-facing. That’s when I tell them this story.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that safety often comes at the cost of protecting just the outer perimeter and not investing enough in what’s called the inner perimeter network like the one this person hacked. This leads to hackers like him having easier access to records, passwords, financial data, and transactions. Once inside the network, there are thousands of vulnerabilities—all his for the taking.\\n\\nThat’s how easy it is to hack a bank. How could Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge have the company avoid this? Well, first, you’d use the Theory of Knowledge: you think you’re safe because you protect the perimeter, but how do you know that? Then, you’d use the Theory of Variation: How are you analyzing and measuring this? You’d use the Theory of Psychology to change the habits of the organization to better understand the importance of security concerns, e.g., letting someone into the\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009178\\n\\nbuilding without checking their ID. Last but not least, there’s the need to have a systems approach to understand the purpose and importance of security in your organization.\\n\\nThe Hacker Threat\\n\\nThe speed, complexity, and scale of daily life—digitally as well as physically— have increased by orders of magnitude thanks to the tools we have today due to the digital Cambrian explosion. But with great power comes great responsibil- ity. Unfortunately, not everyone acts responsibly. Or even ethically. This hacker was able to infiltrate a bank’s IT system, in part thanks to the vast computing power available to him, inexpensive tech tools, and the vulnerabilities in the bank’s network. Those vulnerabilities come from the complexity necessary to manage a modern company’s IT infrastructure.\\n\\nToday, one person with a keyboard can wreak havoc for thousands of oth- ers. Let me share the scale of vulnerabilities we’re talking about here. Back in 2020, a survey revealed that, globally, we’re creating something like 93 billion lines of code every year. Using a conservative estimate, we can figure that we’ve created a trillion lines of code over twenty years. For comparison’s sake, that’s more than the number of stars in the Milky Way.\\n\\nThese aren’t just lines of code that let us scroll through social media or stream our favorite music. This code operates our electrical grids, water sup- plies, trains, planes, and automobiles. This code operates pacemakers, insulin pumps, and heart monitors. Virtually everything you touch today uses soft- ware code at some point or on some level . . . and all code has vulnerabilities. Based on multiple studies of errors per line of code, a very low estimate would put us at half a million individual vulnerabilities at any given moment. Hack- ers use these weak points to gain access to that code. Once they’re in, they can influence or even rewrite those lines of code to whatever they want. And they’re working overtime to do so: some research estimates there are thirty thousand variants of malicious software programs—“malware”—created every single day. Often, this malware gets into a system because some employee downloaded an email attachment.\\n\\nIn the beginning, hacking was the purview of smart, ambitious students who would occasionally pull inconvenient but ultimately harmless pranks. But hacking had taken on a dark side, at least by 1988 when Gene Kim had to deal with the Morris Worm. It’s since become a word synonymous for those with malicious intent. In movies, hackers are almost always bad guys bent on enrich- ing themselves, destroying the world, or both.\\n\\nFortunately for you and me, there are some good guys on our side.\\n\\nCHAPTER 18: DEMING’S DARK LEGACY\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009179\\n\\nThe Cavalry Coming to Save Us\\n\\nWe call them white hat hackers. This comes from old Westerns, where the bad guys always wore black hats while the gun-slinging good guy wore a white cow- boy hat. Security researcher Chris Roberts is one of them. (A good guy, not a cowboy.)\\n\\nFor years, he tried to warn Boeing and Airbus that their planes were vulner- able to software hacking. He and his research team set up a simulated lab where they recreated many of the electronic systems from inside an aircraft. Further- more, Chris had hacked into the planes’ systems on more than a dozen flights. He’d start with the in-flight entertainment system, which was connected to the satellite phones (those in the headrests of the seat in front of you). The satellite communications system was linked to some cabin-control functions that were, in turn, connected to the plane’s avionics systems. Essentially, Chris could take control of an airplane with a laptop. He presented all of this at two different security conferences a couple of years apart. No one, however, gave this much serious attention.\\n\\nIn a conversation, he told me, “If I’m sitting in a plane almost every day, I’m not going to have a hacker crash the plane into a mountain because I didn’t do something when I had the chance.”\\n\\nHe certainly got the attention of the powers-that-be when he tweeted mid-flight that he had hacked into the plane’s systems and was thinking about dropping the oxygen masks. Of course, he was being facetious; Chris would never knowingly endanger people. That’s not the white hat hacker way. Unfor- tunately, the authorities rarely have a good sense of humor. He was met at the Syracuse airport by the FBI.\\n\\nWhile the warrant for search and seizure of his laptops and other equip- ment states that Chris did tamper with a plane’s controls while in flight at some point, Chris says it was a statement taken out of context. In his computer simulations, yes, he and his researchers had gained control of the thrust man- agement computer and simulated a climb but never, he claims, actually carried it out in real life.\\n\\nFor his years of efforts and warnings, he was rewarded with being banned from commercial air travel for life. True to his nature, that isn’t Chris’s focus. “My biggest concern is obviously with the multiple conversations that I had with the authorities. I’m obviously concerned that those were held behind closed doors and apparently, they’re no longer behind closed doors.”1 In other words, the know-how to hack a plane is out in the open. One person. One laptop. One disaster.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009180\\n\\nChris told me, “I’m a bull in a China shop. Josh Corman works with the political red tape, and he’s fantastic at it. Eloquent at working from within the system. Whereas I drop a grenade and wander out.”\\n\\nHe was talking about another white hat hacker. In 2013 at the world’s most infamous hacker convention, DEFCON in Las Vegas, Josh Corman started a grassroots organization named I am the Cavalry. His message is that we can’t wait for the cavalry to save us, be that the government or others; we have to save ourselves. There is currently not a singular, strong voice advocating for better cybersecurity on basic public safety and human life. Banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and the US Department of Defense all have big targets painted on their backs. People take these critical institutions seri- ously. But what about more mundane targets? What about the vulnerabilities in, say, a hospital record system? What about the hundreds of millions of lines of code in a Tesla? What about our food and water supplies? Who’s advocat- ing for better cybersecurity in these areas? People like Chris Roberts and Josh Corman . . . and Billy Rios.\\n\\nBilly Rios needed emergency surgery for leaking spinal fluid. While recov- ering in the hospital, this white hat hacker was curious about the medical device that automatically administered his medicines, called a patient-controlled anal- gesia infusion system (PCA). They are designed to prevent medication errors that sometimes happen when nurses administer medicine manually. Billy’s PCA was manufactured by a company named Hospira. At the time, there were about fifty thousand of Hospira’s PCAs in hospitals around the world at the time. After looking into it, he found that Hospira’s PCAs did not ask for a username and password to set drugs and dosages. Anybody on the hospital’s network—or anyone who hacked it—would have no problem directing the machine to load different types of medications or increasing them to lethal dosages. This isn’t a Robert Ludlum novel where an operative kills a corporate rival or a politician with the press of a button. This is real life.* Billy discovered over a hundred software vulnerabilities with Hospira’s PCA. He tried to notify Hospira, but he ran into the same situation Chris did with Boeing and Airbus: no one took the threats seriously.\\n\\nWhite hat hacker Jeremy Richards and I am the Cavalry took up the cause. They worked tirelessly with the federal government for over two years. Just when it seemed they had made some headway with one official, another politi-\\n\\nAnother real-life example: In 2007, doctors turned off the Bluetooth feature of Vice-President Dick Cheney’s pacemaker for fear hackers would target him. This was probably the inspiration for an episode of Homeland where a terrorist carried out this exact scenario.\\n\\nCHAPTER 18: DEMING’S DARK LEGACY\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009181\\n\\ncian would hear “hacker” and immediately attempt to nix the whole initiative. Josh told me the hardest part was educating elected officials and government workers that he, Jeremy, Billy, and others were actually the good guys trying to protect the innocent from the bad guys.\\n\\nAnother major challenge: they were told that no one would take action unless there was proof of death. That is, someone had to die first, and it had to be demonstrated that it was the fault of that particular machine before any kind of recall or ban would even be considered—exactly what the white hat hackers were trying to prevent in the first place.\\n\\nTheir perseverance paid off: I am the Cavalry was able to convince the FDA to issue the first-ever recall for a medical device without prior proof of patient harm. The night of the FDA announcement, Josh came home and explained to his kids exactly what this meant. They were incredibly proud of their father. On his part, Josh confessed to me that he shed a tear in relief and gratitude.\\n\\nAfter all, it’s not every day you get to save someone’s life, let alone millions.\\n\\nOur Digital Underbelly\\n\\nAs this story shows, hospitals and medical manufacturers have dropped the ball on cybersecurity. Healthcare’s first ransomware attack (where black hat hackers lock people out of their IT systems and hold it hostage until a ransom is paid) happened on February 5, 2016, at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center.\\n\\nHollywood Presbyterian was already known for an incident almost exactly nine years earlier. Gabino Olvera was a homeless man involved in a car accident, crippling him from the waist down. After being initially treated, he became a victim of “patient dumping.” Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, hospitals aren’t supposed to discharge patients with life-threatening conditions. In practice, over a quarter of hospitals are in violation of the act, according to a research study spanning 2005–2014. In Gabino’s case, Hollywood Presbyterian dumped him on the street. The now-paraplegic was found on Skid Row, dragging himself down the side- walk, his belongings in a bag clutched in his teeth, catheter and catheter bag hanging from his body. All of this in addition to continuing acute medical conditions. While the ransomers may have chosen to attack this hospital at random, it wouldn’t surprise me if they weren’t also trying to exact some kind of cosmic revenge at the same time.\\n\\nIt seems unbelievable, but the ransomers demanded only forty crypto currency bitcoins, or about $17,000 at the time. For ten days, Hollywood Pres- byterian’s radiation oncology services, patient medical histories, X-rays, CT\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009182\\n\\nscans, and pharmacy were all offline. The attack even impacted ER systems. Medical staff had to resort to pen and paper.\\n\\nOver the next year, sixty-five UK hospitals fell prey to ransomware. In addition to their computers, the attack also affected their storage refrigerators and MRI machines. In an interview with ABC Nightline, Josh Corman said, “[Healthcare] went from being a prone and prey industry with no predators to becoming the number-one-targeted industry in less than a year.”2\\n\\nIt’s easy to see why. For one, because we’re talking about life and death, healthcare organizations need restored access to their computer systems more urgently than, say, an automaker. Like Hollywood Presbyterian, many victim- ized organizations choose to simply pay the ransom, and they usually do so as quickly as possible to get their systems restored. Two, healthcare is partic- ularly vulnerable. Like Hospira’s PCA, many hospitals have advanced medical devices connected to their networks. The makers and sellers of such devices are responsible for the software, but as Billy Rios found, they often use default usernames and passwords (often readily available on the internet). While ven- dors regularly update their products’ software, they rarely do so in regard to cybersecurity measures. Three, a study revealed that 85% of hospitals lack even a single qualified cybersecurity professional on staff. Not one. Banks, insurance companies, and other places that keep our money all have stringent cybersecu- rity. The places that keep us alive? Not so much.\\n\\nIt’s one thing to go after our financial security. It’s something else to start attacking the foundational level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, from our phys- ical health to our food and water supplies. But that’s where we are today.\\n\\nHealthcare is just one industry. Consider the vulnerability of other indus- tries that affect our daily lives. The October 2021 cybersecurity attack on the dairy company Schreiber Foods is a good example. Schreiber is the second-larg- est US supplier of cream cheese. Just before the important food-stuffed holidays of Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, and Christmas, grocery stores’ shelves were nearly empty of cream cheese. I remember my wife coming home and declaring she couldn’t find an ounce of the stuff if her life depended on it. I somewhat jokingly refer to it as the Schmear Apocalypse. While cream cheese may not be necessary for life, Schreiber serves as an example of how lax secu- rity at just one company can have a ripple effect throughout our food supply chain.\\n\\nAlthough my vegan friends would argue with me, for most of us, meat is necessary for life. That’s what makes the attack on JBS—the world’s largest beef supplier—scarier than the Schreiber story. The Russian-based hacker group REvil shut down meat-processing plants across the US. Fortunately for the food supply chain, JBS quickly paid the $11 million ransom and got the vast\\n\\nCHAPTER 18: DEMING’S DARK LEGACY\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009183\\n\\nmajority of its facilities back online. Otherwise, the US would have lost a quar- ter of its beef supplies across the nation. Remember the toilet paper shortage and how crazy people were acting during the pandemic? Imagine that instead of toilet paper, we’re talking about food and basic life necessities.\\n\\nWhat’s scarier is discovering that these hackers can attack almost any- body. The JBS attack came just a month after the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. The entire Texas-New Jersey pipeline carrying 2.5 million barrels a day of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and jet fuel suddenly ran dry. This pipe- line supplies about half of the gasoline for the East Coast. People immediately started panic buying, causing shortages and price spikes throughout that part of the country. Compared with JBS, Colonial got a bargain: a mere $4.4 million in bitcoin.\\n\\nUp to now, we’ve discussed black hat hackers extorting organizations for money. While they’re bad enough, consider the sickos who actively want to cause personal harm. Two days before Super Bowl LV in Tampa, an employee at a water treatment plant in the area noticed the cursor on a computer screen behaving oddly. After nothing seemed to come of it, the employee dismissed it . . . until a few hours later when the screen showed the automated program began increasing sodium hydroxide levels (lye). Municipal facilities rou- tinely use lye to control the acidity in our drinking water as well as to remove heavy metals, making it safe for us. One hundred parts per million is a safe lye-to- water ratio. The employee saw the attacker remotely manipulating the computer to increase this level to over eleven thousand parts per million. That much lye would do exactly what you think: severely burn skin, eyes, throats, lungs, and digestive systems, leading to serious if not deadly injury. Thankfully, the employee manually returned levels to a safe ratio and reported the incident. An investigation revealed a vulnerability in TeamViewer, a program that allows remote access to Microsoft Windows systems. If that doesn’t scare you enough, then maybe I should mention TeamViewer is also used in the remote manage- ment of hundreds of chemical and nuclear plants.\\n\\nThe Adversary\\n\\nShannon Lietz has over two decades of experience in advanced security defenses and next-generation cybersecurity solutions. She coined the term DevSecOps to add a security component to DevOps. Shannon categorizes black hat hackers into four distinct types.\\n\\nThe first are information brokers: bad actors looking for opportunities to make a quick buck by selling information to others, who then use it for nefar- ious purposes. They might know network structure, but they don’t really get\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009184\\n\\ntheir hands dirty. Mostly, they discover a vulnerability (often at their employer) and then sell that knowledge. The second category includes those who directly attack IT systems, either for ransom, bragging rights, learning/honing their skills, or simply for kicks. The third category drives massive amounts of web traffic to specific websites. The servers aren’t built for that quantity of views and crash under the weight (known as distributed denial-of-service attacks or DDoS). Shannon calls the last category advanced adversaries. These types pri- marily steal data to sell to others, acting as a kind of black-market wholesaler on the dark web.\\n\\nWhile it sounds like science fiction, the dark web is quite real. Everyone is familiar with the “surface web,” the publicly accessible websites we see every day. Most people have interacted with the “deep web.” This is simply the parts of the internet accessible only with logins and passwords, like your email or bank account. There is a third, hidden layer, where the really nasty stuff happens, called the dark web, often accessed via The Onion Router (usually referred to as simply “Tor”).\\n\\nTwo researchers from King’s College in London carried out an in-depth review of hidden services available on the dark web. They found 57% of sites offer illicit material, everything from hacked Netflix accounts and credit card numbers to guns, counterfeit currency, and false identities.\\n\\nAdvanced adversaries also include state-sponsored attacks. One of the worst cybersecurity breaches was when the Chinese government hacked the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Millions of federal employees’ identities were compromised, including the fingerprints of the sitting US pres- ident. A consultant working on the breach told me that a handful of intelligence operatives in the field simply vanished and were assumed dead after their true identities were exposed (referred to internally as “sources and methods”). The background checks, digital security checks, and background interviews with friends, family, and neighbors of federal employees were suddenly available on the open market. Who knows how many officials and key government servants were blackmailed?\\n\\nFormer CIA officer Valerie Plame said, “The OPM breach is absolutely catastrophic for our national security,”3 and she should know. Her leaked iden- tity led to the Plame Affair, resulting in the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney’s former chief of staff, Scooter Libby.\\n\\nAnother state-sponsored attack: Russia’s breach of SolarWinds, a Tex- as-based company that makes IT management and administration software tools and programs. At the time of the attack, one of their most successful products was a network-monitoring tool, used by over thirty-three thousand organizations, including nearly all of the Fortune 500 as well as a number\\n\\nCHAPTER 18: DEMING’S DARK LEGACY\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009185\\n\\nof federal agencies. The black hat hackers behind it were especially patient, hacking into SolarWinds and inserting malware while the software was being updated. This was a sophisticated attack. The malware could detect when the code was being compiled and modify the source code beforehand; the code had to sit dormant and teach itself how the software was built in order to tamper with it and hide its tracks with fake logs.\\n\\nWhen SolarWinds released the updated software, thousands of custom- ers downloaded the update and installed it on their computers. The Russian malware then created a digital backdoor, allowing hackers access to customers’ networks.* At last count, systems at the Departments of Justice, the Treasury, and Energy had been breached, and even the Pentagon itself. These are all examples of Deming’s dark legacy that have led to the cyber crisis we find our- selves in today.\\n\\nNow, let’s take a look at how Deming’s legacy is also coming to save us.\\n\\nCybersecurity and Profound Knowledge\\n\\nIn February of 2021, the lumbering bureaucratic machine that is Washington, DC, did take a step in the right direction. That’s when President Joseph Biden issued an executive order requiring the federal government’s vendors to supply a software bill of materials when servicing federal agencies—something Josh Corman had been working to get Uncle Sam to do for over a decade. Manufac- turers in most industries already submit bills of materials so that vendors can track where different components came from. A software bill of materials is the digital version: software vendors must document where they obtained the code in their software, be it open source, proprietary, or commercially available. This is straight out of supply-chain management and the Toyota Way.\\n\\nThat’s not a coincidence: A particular team at CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) was the primary driver of this executive order . . . a team that so happened to be led by Josh Corman. The white knight comes to save us again. Josh is a student of Goldratt and Deming. Managing a supply chain involves looking at all the steps in a manufacturing process— from acquiring raw materials to distributing the finished product—to find the weak links in the chain: that is, the vulnerable spots where any kind of disrup- tion would prove disastrous. As I’ve said, Josh is a cybersecurity expert, but he applied Goldratt and Deming to the software supply chain.\\n\\nHis team played a major role in Operation Warp Speed, the federal gov- ernment’s nationally coordinated, multibillion-dollar program to create and\\n\\nThis is considered a new kind of cyberattack, where adversaries create code as part of the\\n\\nsoftware supply chain.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009186\\n\\ndistribute the COVID-19 vaccines as quickly as possible.* CISA’s purview was to examine the potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities of the effort. They found a frightening number of them. For instance, his team identified a particular manufacturer that supplied many of the DNA and mRNA vaccine developers. They soon discovered the company had only three IT people, none of them security specialists. According to Josh, “You could sneeze on that facility and the result would be a lot of dead Americans a few months after.”4 If a hacker were to deploy malware at that one site, they could effectively hold the entirety of Operation Warp Speed hostage.\\n\\nAs you might have already noticed, in order to do their job, Josh Corman’s team had to become experts in manufacturing supply chain management. He said it was life imitating art: he’d begun his journey using Goldratt and Dem- ing and the manufacturing supply chain as metaphors for the software supply chain but was now using the software supply chain to examine manufacturing. His team identified nearly a hundred bottlenecks, any one of which could have significantly slowed the development and distribution of the vaccines.\\n\\nA non-software vulnerability they found was—are you ready for this?— dry ice. During transport, the vaccines needed to be kept at –80°F (–112°C). At the time the team was studying the supply chain, no one had a clue as to exactly how many different companies would develop a vaccine. In fact, no one knew if any vaccine would be developed. It was unprecedented to create one for a coronavirus. But assuming there would be enough for the entire country meant massive amounts of dry ice to transport the vaccines. Well, how is dry ice made? Josh educated me on the fact that it’s a product of gas produced when refining oil. That was a problem, as the entire country was quarantined. Because demand dried up, gasoline production fell. Nobody was identifying all of these interconnected constraints to vaccinating the country except Josh’s team at CISA. We’ll never know how many cyberattacks never happened because of their efforts nor how many lives were saved because of those identified bottlenecks that weren’t disrupted . . . thanks to Josh Cor- man, his team, and Ed.\\n\\nThis would be the fourth time Deming’s teachings played a major role in a nationwide coordinated effort. The first was at Aberdeen, trying to out-man- ufacture the Axis Powers. The second was in the recovery and rebuilding of Japan’s economy. The third was the quality revolution in the 1980s to save American manufacturing. At some point, you have to hand it to him: Deming’s teachings are eternal and universal.\\n\\nOperation Warp Speed had the same “one for all and all for one” esprit de corps I believe that Deming saw at Aberdeen and inspired in the Japanese economic miracle: a nation pulling together for a common cause.\\n\\nCHAPTER 18: DEMING’S DARK LEGACY\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009187\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\nOut of the Cyber Crisis\\n\\nMy aim is to provide a foundation or system of theory for continual change of practices for management to keep up with the changes that are taking place in this world. Even, perhaps, to guide the changes to come.\\n\\n—Dr. W. Edwards Deming\\n\\nIn 1982, the US was in a crisis.\\n\\nA crisis of identity, of energy, of economic sovereignty—you name it. Although he was enjoying the beginnings of Demingmania and his fame from the NBC documentary, Deming’s overall attitude was one of pessimism. He feared that business, government, and even education were too far gone to bring back from the brink of self-destruction . . . but he had to try, anyway. Out of this urgency came his 1982 book Out of the Crisis. He wrote it almost as a last-ditch effort to reform these three critical sectors of American life before they imploded of their own weight.\\n\\nUpon completion of reading his book, I couldn’t believe how a man born in 1900 and writing in 1982 could so accurately capture the essence of everything we were trying to say in DevOps. (Of course, at the time I had no idea his finger- prints were already all over software development.) I immediately assembled a presentation I called “Deming to DevOps” to challenge my global community to reexamine the tech industry through Deming’s eyes. He truly was “the Prophet,” able to foresee the very problems we faced in software development and, more importantly, to provide us the principles we need to solve them ourselves.\\n\\nAs I presented in the previous chapter, the world is just now beginning to grapple with the digital crisis we’re in. Cybersecurity is minimal or overlooked altogether in industries and organizations that affect our everyday lives. Any- one from anywhere in the world with a little know-how can exploit these digital systems to disrupt our lives or even threaten them. The digital world is far too complex to be solved with simple solutions. We need a systemized, unified framework and a united front to keep the bad guys from hurting innocents.\\n\\nDeming’s System of Profound Knowledge is the lens through which organizations can experience profound change. However, the 14 Points for Management still remain the best applicable lessons on how to achieve Pro- found Knowledge. Were he alive today, lecturing a company or governmental\\n\\norganization on the cybersecurity threat, Ed might present his 14 Points using true-to-life examples, such as something like this:\\n\\n#1: Mission Focused\\n\\n“Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.”\\n\\nIn 2019, Springhill Medical Center in Mobile, Alabama, recorded the first death related to a ransomware attack. For eight days, the facility’s capabilities were vastly reduced, including blocked access to patient records and even disabled fetal heartbeat monitors. A pregnant patient was unaware of the attack when she checked in to have her baby. Because of the disabled equipment, the med- ical staff was unaware the baby was in distress as a result of the umbilical cord wrapped around the neck. The infant suffered a severe brain injury and died nine months later.\\n\\nMost people in an organization view governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) activities as an annoying inconvenience—something to leave to the IT risk teams. When you silo cybersecurity, seeing it as an independent component instead of a system, you put your entire organization at risk. Cybersecurity can’t be a box to check off; it must be a way of thinking embraced by everyone.\\n\\nEarlier, I mentioned Shannon Lietz, the person who coined DevSecOps. She says security needs to be designed into an organization’s systems—not something that gets bolted on after the fact. It must be a shared mindset between software developers, operations people, compliance professionals, and security scientists. Moreover, it’s leadership’s responsibility to educate the entire organization about the roles and responsibilities related to cybersecu- rity. Annual staff trainings aren’t nearly enough.\\n\\nEd said companies should “create constancy of purpose.” By this, he meant an aim, direction, or purpose—a desired outcome. Eliyahu Goldratt named his book The Goal after this concept. Bestselling author Simon Sinek calls it the why. Most modern organizations have mission statements that pay lip service to this idea, but few truly have a purpose. Fewer still have a shared purpose across the organization.*\\n\\nIn GRC, the shared purpose is to protect the brand. My friend Courtney Kissner at Nike shared with me that, when the priorities are stacked, protecting the brand lands on top. Organizations often lose sight of this fact. To them, security, with all the toil and muck it entails, is a pain in the ass. They forget that GRC is trying to prevent those kinds of catastrophic breaches that open the organization up to legal liabilities, bad press, or even operations getting crippled.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009190\\n\\nThe mission of any organization should be to responsibly provide its prod- ucts and services to others. Recall Paul O’Neill at Alcoa. The 1800s railroad and shipping magnate Collis Potter Huntington once said, “We shall build good ships here. At a profit, if we can. At a loss, if we must. But always good ships.” Quality is paramount.\\n\\nFor Deming, this type of long-term thinking was the opposite of the short- term mentality he saw so prevalent. American managers didn’t have a steadfast commitment to quality but to quarterly earnings. The same is still happening today. Organizational leaders don’t design security (a.k.a. digital quality) into their systems at the outset; it’s something to be addressed at some future point in time.\\n\\nJust as Deming advocated continuous improvement in processes and products, he would advocate continuous improvement in cybersecurity as well. It’s an integral part of delivering quality today. Springhill Medical Center is a good example of an organization where security was not part of the mission.\\n\\n#2: Adapt or Die\\n\\n“Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western man- agement must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.”\\n\\nIn Deming’s way of thinking, it wasn’t just about adopting new practices but embracing an entirely new mindset. Deming once said, “It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.”1 As new cybersecurity threats arise, leaders in organizations from small businesses to global enterprises to national agen- cies must adapt to these new challenges. Unfortunately, many organizations’ leaders still approach IT with the mindset of Henry Ford, Frederick Taylor, and Alfred Sloan. At the federal level in the US, these deterministic approaches have been institutionalized and enshrined in law and practice. As I hope I’ve demon- strated in this book, those practices were out of date a century ago. We cannot possibly imagine that the old ways are up to the task.\\n\\nWhen he published Out of the Crisis, Ed wrote of a new economic age. IBM had just presented the first personal computer to the world the previous year. Answering machines weren’t altogether commonplace, and the marvel of fax machines was still new. I doubt Deming ever wore a pager, but I wouldn’t doubt if his secretary Ceil paged more than one executive to arrange her boss’s sched- ule. On the other hand, I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Ed had played with VisiCalc, the world’s first spreadsheet, created by Dan Bricklin.\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009191\\n\\nAt Deming’s first book’s publishing, we were in the midst of the Cold War stalemate with the USSR. Being the eternal philomath he was, I imagine Deming read Donella Meadows’s Limits to Growth about the impending over- population of the planet. If I had to bet, I’d say he probably knew of the work of two leading Israeli scientists pioneering the field of behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. All of this is to say that Deming wasn’t naive. He knew the world had become quite complex since World War II.\\n\\nThis was, in fact, the very reason he was so passionate about his message in trying to raise the alarm to American leaders. He foresaw the problems we live with today. Perhaps Point #2 could have simply been “Wake up!” The way leaders had managed companies and national agencies in the 1950s and 1960s led to the problems of the 1970s. Companies like Nashua Paper, Ford, Marshall Industries, and others embraced the fact that what they’d been doing wasn’t working anymore.\\n\\nIf he were here today, he’d shout at organizational leaders, “Wake up! The way you’ve approached IT for the last four decades still doesn’t work! The prob- lems are too complex; simple solutions won’t work. You have to embrace a new way of thinking about security and safety.” Today, leaders wait until there’s a problem before they fix it. This approach must be replaced with a process of continuous learning, continuous improvement, continuous adaptation, and continuous change.\\n\\nTwo decades ago, IT was a department. Today, most companies are built around their tech. Two decades ago, cybersecurity was an activity. Today, it must be part and parcel of how organizations are designed, built, and grown. Imagine what Deming would think about a self-driving car with 500 million lines of code that sometimes has to make life-or-death decisions without real- time human input.\\n\\nDeming was appalled when an acquaintance of his was allowed inside a critical US chemical plant despite the name and date on the visitor’s security badge being completely wrong. Deming worked on classified projects during World War II, so he knew a thing or two about security and keeping out enemy spies. But without being on a war footing, the country had grown lax about security. The same holds true today: In 2018, a former SunTrust employee was able to steal 1.5 million people’s banking information, allegedly because the company had a laissez-faire approach to clearing former employees’ access codes. Banks spend millions of dollars on physical security, armored trucks, time-lock vaults, dye packs, and more to foil armed robberies. They’re used to that sort of frontal assault. Yet they leave their digital back doors wide open.\\n\\nIt’s a new world. It requires new methods.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009192\\n\\n#3: Stop Inspecting Quality\\n\\n“Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.”\\n\\nDeming never liked the term total quality management. To him, quality was already an all-encompassing concept. Putting “total” in front of it was redun- dant or, worse, suggestive that quality could be done piecemeal instead of including the whole organization.\\n\\nInspecting a product once it’s built doesn’t improve its quality. Inspection merely discovers a lack of quality. Quality isn’t something to be added at the end but to be designed into the product from the get-go. Deming said quality isn’t so much about improving the product as it is about improving the process. That’s what Walter Shewhart gave us in 1924 with statistical process control: a tool to help improve the manufacturing process, not the finished product. A high-quality product was merely the output. In 1984, Deming said it would take another fifty years before the world fully appreciated what Shewhart gifted us. I think Deming may have given us more credit than we’re due.\\n\\nBefore 2003, most organizations building software relied on the old inspec- tion model. A quality assurance team (QA), often referred to simply as testers, would look for issues after the code was built. Strip away the cool, shiny tech exterior and you’d find Henry Ford and Frederick Taylor at the heart of software engineering. In 2003, Mary Poppendieck published Lean Software Development. That’s when things began to change. I’ve already related how John Allspaw and Greg Hammond shocked the global IT community in 2009 with the revelation they were doing ten software deployments a day at Yahoo’s Flickr. Two years later, Jon Jenkins dropped the bombshell that Amazon was deploying code on average every 11.7 seconds.\\n\\nMary, Tom, John, Greg, and Jon pioneered the new software delivery method called continuous delivery, the seeds of DevOps. This shifted the focus from improving a software product to improving the software process. The DevSecOps movement took the same idea and introduced the concept of designing security in at the beginning instead of using the inspection method at the end.\\n\\nI had the good fortune to interview Harper Reed for this book. He was the CTO of Project Narwhal, the software behind Barack Obama’s successful 2012 reelection campaign. The team used the DevOps method to design and\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009193\\n\\nadapt the system to anticipate nearly every conceivable disaster. This foresight allowed the system to stay up and running through the “Great Amazon Out- age” of October 1; Hurricane Sandy later that month, which ravaged the entire Eastern seaboard; and the tremendous stress of last-minute get-out-the-vote efforts on election day. By building quality in from the very beginning, Project Narwhal’s vulnerabilities were exposed early on and addressed.\\n\\nContrast that to Mitt Romney’s get-out-the-vote software, ORCA.* It was, in part, supposed to allow volunteers outside polling stations to report who had voted. The idea was to direct time and efforts to registered Republicans who hadn’t yet voted or to increase turnout in low-polling areas. As I understand it, the Romney campaign hired a prestigious tech consulting firm (probably one like Accenture or EY) that developed software using the old assembly-line (waterfall) method—you know, waiting until the end to inspect for quality. The campaign touted it as their secret weapon, declaring that Narwhal was nothing compared to what they were building.\\n\\nHow did things turn out? As the tech news provider CNET put it, “Orca was supposed to give the Romney campaign a technical advantage over Obama on election day. It got harpooned instead.”2 Bugs, a complete shutdown due to a mistaken denial-of-service attack, system overload—it was a mess. Meanwhile, Narwhal swam on smoothly.\\n\\n#4: The Fallacy of the Lowest Bidder\\n\\n“End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.”\\n\\nI’ve consulted at hundreds of Fortune 500 companies over the last forty years.\\n\\nTheir cafeterias suck. There have been one or two with food and service north of mediocre, but that’s it. These companies have no idea how much money they’re losing by going with the lowest bidder. Beginning around 2006, I noticed many of the newer web- and cloud-based companies I consulted for had terrific on-site food services. I’m not sure if it was by accident or design, but it seriously boosted company performance. Instead of driving down costs, these companies spent a lot more. Better service translated into higher employee morale. Instead of people going off-site and spending an additional thirty or forty minutes for lunch, they stayed on-site and took shorter lunch breaks. Most importantly,\\n\\nSo named because orcas prey on narwhals. I give them a D– for creativity.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009194\\n\\nemployees ate together and organized more lunch-and-learns, increasing cross-pollination and collaboration among them. Imagine how much going with the lowest food service vendor would have cost!*\\n\\nWestern companies often spend a lot of time and money finding other suppliers and quickly switching, even for a marginal financial gain. They’ll outsource to the cheapest supplier, not considering the hidden costs they’re buying. Companies often use multiple suppliers to protect against supply-chain disruptions and also so that the vendors compete against each other vying for the company’s business. As the Japanese so ably demonstrated in post–World War II, tighter relationships with fewer suppliers lead to increased process alignment and lower overall costs.\\n\\nBut the answer isn’t to just work with a limited number of suppliers. For example, when it comes to cybersecurity, one major obstacle is organizations’ purchasing and procurement departments. Many of the Fortune 500 won’t allow employees to purchase software from anyone but approved vendors. A company’s purchasing team and cyber risk team have two different motiva- tions. Purchasing’s job is to get the best deal financially—which is rarely the best product. In some organizations, it can take years for a software provider to become an approved vendor. At today’s pace, some enterprises are buying brand-new software that’s already obsolete.\\n\\nTo save further costs, many purchasing departments choose to get nearly all of their software from a single source. This one-size-fits-all approach is called an enterprise license agreement, and the discounts are substantial (sometimes up to 40%), representing millions of dollars in “savings.” The problem is that their single vendor almost certainly doesn’t have the best solution for every single software product. Take the SolarWinds breach. In my professional opin- ion, their network-monitoring tool isn’t the best one on the market. However, it does have a lovely price point. While this type of cyberattack can happen with any vendor, there are several higher-end tools I’ve worked with that have tighter controls over their internal software supply chain.\\n\\nDeming admonished organizations to use fewer suppliers but for a specific purpose: to reduce variation. I read about a great example in Tom Limoncel- li’s book The Practice of System and Network Administration. He wrote about Google’s internal Death Squad† team, which ensured only two versions of the\\n\\nFunnily enough, when I read The New Economics, I discovered that Deming had made a strik-\\n\\ningly similar observation years before I did, when he discussed the benefits of the Detroit News losing money on its cafeteria but more than making up for the loss in productivity and morale. † A terrible name, in my opinion. Death squad usually refers to dictators lining up innocents and\\n\\ncommitting wholesale slaughter.\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009195\\n\\nLinux operating system were in use throughout the company at any given time. Doing so meant that software developed in one part of the company (say, Google Maps) would work well with software developed in another part (say, Google Earth). This was a key component in Google’s ability to control its systems at scale.\\n\\nIf the Obamacare IT team had heeded Deming’s advice from 1982, it might have avoided the rollout fiasco of Healthcare.gov in 2013. On October 1, the website launched to allow people to enroll. However, there were serious tech problems that prevented many people from enrolling for weeks.* This, despite costing $1.7 billion, according to the US Inspector General in an investigation the next year. A consultant for the project told me Healthcare.gov used more than twelve different logging frameworks (the way computers record and store system activity data). Reducing variation at the macro level was obviously not part of the project’s specifications.\\n\\nIf only they’d listened to Deming.\\n\\n#5: Never Stop Improving\\n\\n“Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.”\\n\\nIn Out of the Crisis, Deming observed the West focused more on specification, while the East focused more on uniformity. We saw this with the Mazda trans- mission example. US-based suppliers built the transmission “to spec,” while their Japanese counterparts minimized variation to their pragmatic limits.\\n\\nIn IT, most cybersecurity activities are specification-based. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains a list of common vulnerabilities in software. All public and private organizations rely on this database to know if a specific collection of code has documented vulnerabili- ties, rated on a scale of severity. The famous Equifax breach vulnerability, for example, was a ten, the most severe.\\n\\nIn the industry, there’s a term called “zero-day vulnerability.” This happens when someone (a vendor, white hat hacker, tester, etc.) first discovers a flaw in software that’s already been deployed to the real world. Those organizations using the software have, in theory, zero days to fix this; we assume the bad guys already know about the vulnerability. If they didn’t before, they certainly\\n\\nThe Daily Show host Jon Stewart challenged then-Secretary of Health and Human Services to\\n\\na race: “I’m going to try and download every single movie ever made, and you’re going to try to sign up for Obamacare, and we’ll see which happens first.”\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009196\\n\\ndo once it’s documented. As soon as there’s a patch to fix the software, every- one downloads it and updates their code ASAP. Their software is now up to specifications.\\n\\nThis is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. The bad guys do bad things while the good guys try to keep up as well as they can. Scanning software for known NIST vulnerabilities is akin to a specification implementation. In other words, “We should not have any software with these vulnerabilities.”\\n\\nShannon Lietz takes what I call a uniformity approach. Instead of a purely defensive stance—“How can we protect ourselves against attacks?”—she takes a proactive stance, which she calls adversary management. She monitors the behavior and motivations of attackers. How often do adversaries attack? What’s their purpose or aim? What do they target and what do they ignore? How long will they mount an attack before giving up?\\n\\nIn effect, Shannon uses the PDSA cycle to continuously improve her orga- nization’s cybersecurity. Instead of being a step behind, she tries to stay a step ahead, learning from hackers so that she anticipates their moves. She is institutionalizing a continuous security improvement process. She shares this information throughout the organization, a subtle way of reminding all that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility.\\n\\n#6: Train for a Systems Thinking Mindset\\n\\n“Institute training on the job.”\\n\\nRemember Peter Senge from the Macy Cybernetics Conferences and his work with John Waraniak at GM? Deming was ninety years old when Senge, rela- tively unknown outside of academia at the time, asked Deming for feedback on his forthcoming book The Fifth Discipline (soon to become a bestseller and a classic). To his surprise and gratification, Deming promptly returned his letter with a note Senge felt obliged to quote in his book’s introduction:\\n\\nOur prevailing system of management has destroyed our people. Peo- ple are born with intrinsic motivation, self-respect, dignity, curiosity to learn, joy in learning. The forces of destruction begin with toddlers—a prize for the best Halloween costume, grades in school, gold stars— and on up through the university. On the job, people, teams, and divisions are ranked, reward for the top, punishment for the bottom. Management by objectives, quotas, incentive pay, business plans, put together separately, division by division, cause further loss, unknown and unknowable.3\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009197\\n\\nAs I related, Doris Quinn told me that when she accompanied Deming on his four-day seminars, he collectively spent less than a day presenting on sta- tistical process control. The lion’s share was devoted to telling managers and executives how to better manage their people. He would relate the story of how Japan in 1945, decimated beyond hope of repair and with no natural resources to speak of, relied on its people to be reborn and go on to become the second largest economy in the world. People, he said, were the key. He would often lament that America’s worst waste was companies’ failure to fully utilize their people’s abilities. One of his admonishments to fix that was to “institute train- ing on the job.”\\n\\nIf you’ve ever been part of a big company, you should be rolling your eyes at the thought of corporate training. If Deming were here today, he’d abhor what passes for training in most companies. His idea wasn’t for people to file into a classroom, listen to a presentation, and then return to the factory floor or their desks with no idea how to put their training into practice. He specifically said institute training on the job.\\n\\nWhen people are being trained, they need to understand what the job involves and why it’s done in the first place. Then, they need to continually learn through practical experience, experimenting with new methods and ideas, studying results, and striving to be as perfect as pragmatically possible.\\n\\n#7: Don’t Manage—Lead\\n\\n“Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.”\\n\\n“Help people and machines and gadgets do a better job.”4 That was Deming’s definition of leadership. It wasn’t about who was in authority and who got pun- ished. It was about improving the process.\\n\\nTo my mind, leadership is mentoring; being more of a coach than a police officer who makes sure she writes her daily ticket quota. Leadership is about inspiration, setting the vision, and “constancy of purpose.”\\n\\nDeming often gave his take on the old adage: “In God we trust. All others must bring data.” Leaders don’t make knee-jerk reactions; they analyze data. They know how to separate common cause variation from special cause to sort what can be brought under control versus what can’t.\\n\\nMost organizations think one of a manager’s main functions is to put out fires: all the problems that crop up over the normal (and abnormal) course of business. Problems like security vulnerabilities. In the 1980s, the UK gov-\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009198\\n\\nernment developed a set of recommendations to standardize IT management practices across what’s now His Majesty’s Kingdom. It’s called the information technology infrastructure library, or ITIL for short. Deming was quite popular in the UK; one of the best books on Deming is The Deming Dimension, written by Dr. Henry Neave, a statistician and father of the British Deming Associ- ation. I was gratified to learn that ITIL’s continuous-improvement concepts were based on the PDSA cycle.\\n\\nAccording to ITIL, an IT “incident” is an unplanned interruption or reduced quality of an IT service. There are four levels of severity, starting at P1 and going up to P4.* Most organizations have enough resources to resolve only P1 incidents. Managers responsible for cybersecurity are primarily motivated to reduce P1 incidents. The more they see that number shrink, the better they believe things are.\\n\\nIncidents are software quality issues that need to be dealt with quickly and quietly. This is not leadership. This is firefighting. Deming, in contrast, would probably get rid of the arbitrary four categories and instead use the System of Profound Knowledge to create a mathematical approach to managing security incidents. For example, instead of looking at incidents through arbitrary cat- egories (P1 to P4), System of Profound Knowledge could be used to identify common-cause and special-cause patterns across all incidents.\\n\\nLeadership would be those same supervisors using these incidents as on-the-job training opportunities. John Allspaw says incidents are “unplanned investments.” The resources are a sunk cost. Why not turn them on their head and see them as possible sources of return on investment (ROI)? Why allow the opportunity to slip by? That’s leadership. That’s helping “people and machines and gadgets do a better job.”\\n\\n#8: No Fear\\n\\n“Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.”\\n\\nAbout 2010, I remember some Facebook developers telling an audience that new software engineers to the company deploy their own new code on the very first day of work, even before finishing all their paperwork. Someone in the audience asked, “What would you do if they broke the system?” The developer replied, “If they can break our system on the first day of work, they have done their job, and we have not.”\\n\\nFor my tech readers: the delineations between the four are fuzzy, at best.\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009199\\n\\nStarting around this time, a trend emerged in the software industry called the blameless post-mortem. Instead of assigning a problem or vulnerability to a certain person, blame would be placed on the system. (I can hear Deming cheering, even now.) After the incident had been handled, the stakeholders would hold a post-incident review to learn what had happened, how it had hap- pened, and how to improve their software delivery process. The digital world is too complex to settle for simple solutions, so the best organizational teams stopped looking at the problem (a.k.a. the outcome) and started looking at all the parts that together make up the software delivery system.\\n\\nThis is exactly what Deming meant when he told managers to “drive out fear so that everyone may work effectively for the company.” Instead of the old Ford and Taylor command-and-control style of management, Deming directed managers to build trust throughout the organization. Eliminate fear: the fear of not getting a bonus; the fear of making a mistake; the fear of not meeting annual MBOs, MBRs, and KPIs; and the fear of not measuring up to their peers.\\n\\nDeming was especially miffed at those who didn’t understand basic math- ematical functions but were managed by them. General Electric’s Jack Welch was famous for his dictum that every business unit must fire the bottom 10% of performers each year. It doesn’t matter how hard a group works or how much they achieve. Mathematically, half of a group will perform above average; half will perform below. That’s how averages work. In each of GE’s business units, it didn’t matter if the bottom 10% were outperforming the top 50% from a few years earlier; the bottom 10% had to go.* This was a fear-based organization, based on the old deterministic mentality of the “rugged individualist” that pre- vails, especially in American culture. Deming saw this at Hawthorne and then again at the Census Bureau. Japan showed him a better way: organizations built on trust and mutual loyalty.\\n\\nIn 2012, Google set out to answer the question “What makes teams suc- cessful?” The project’s name, Aristotle, came from the Greek philosopher’s famous quote, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” After surveying hundreds of Google employees across 180 teams, one of their five key findings was something called psychological safety. The more secure team members felt in expressing ideas and participating in discussions, the better the team’s over- all performance. The more the discussion was dominated by one person or a small group of people, the worse the team performed.\\n\\nDeming used to make the joke that “Everyone in our organization should be above average.”\\n\\nThis is, of course, mathematically impossible.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009200\\n\\nAmy Edmonson, a leading researcher on psychological safety, defines it as the belief that the team is capable of supporting interpersonal risks. A psycho- logically safe team isn’t power-ordered and encourages different perspectives, irrespective of sex, gender, expression, age, orientation, disability, physical attributes, culture, ethnicity, personal beliefs, and more.\\n\\nFear-based organizational cultures can be costly. Even deadly. On October 29, 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Lion Air crashed thirteen minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 people aboard. Reports indicated a malfunctioning flight-control system had been disabled in an attempt to restore control. Barely four months later, another 737 MAX crashed six min- utes after takeoff. None of the 157 survived.\\n\\nSome suspected Boeing’s MCAS, the maneuvering characteristics augmen- tation system. The MCAS was designed to counteract the airplane’s tendency to push the nose up during certain maneuvers. As part of a larger attempt to shave off as much pilot training time as possible, Boeing removed the MCAS from the plane’s standard operating manual. It argued that the MCAS wasn’t designed for use during normal flight operations and should therefore be excluded. The FAA agreed. When the 737 MAX entered service in 2017, there wasn’t a word about the MCAS. Pilots began flying planes totally unaware of this “feature.” When the MCAS glitched, none of those pilots knew what was happening, much less how to fix it.\\n\\nTo make matters even more tragic: Boeing knew the MCAS sometimes operated erroneously long before the Lion Air crash, an ensuing investigation found. The investigators discovered some members of the company under- stood the potential for disaster, but this information was buried in isolated pockets around the company.* For those who knew there was a problem, the investigators found the employees had unclear reporting procedures to flag such crucial issues.\\n\\nTo add a little context to this decision, consider the fact that Boeing was under enormous pressure to get the 737 MAX into service as quickly as pos- sible. For the first time, American Airlines was considering buying a fleet of planes from the European manufacturer Airbus. To thwart this deal, Boeing modified its existing 737 design as a cheaper alternative, with one of the key savings being that American Airlines’ twelve thousand pilots wouldn’t have to be retrained on a whole new plane.\\n\\nContrast that environment to Toyota’s, where any employee on the line could pull the Andon cord, bringing production to a standstill for even a minor\\n\\nFor an in-depth review of this phenomenon, review the work of Diane Vaughan, especially her\\n\\nconcept of normalization of deviance, coined while analyzing the Challenger disaster.\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009201\\n\\nquality issue. In the case of the Boeing 737 MAX, hundreds of lives were at stake . . . yet no one pulled the Andon cord.\\n\\nDoes that sound like a psychologically safe place to work? Were people encouraged to voice their concerns and offer dissenting opinions? Did they have a metaphorical Andon cord to halt everything in order to fix a fatal flaw? I’ve never worked with Boeing, but my money says no.\\n\\n#9: No Silos\\n\\n“Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of produc- tion and in use that may be encountered with the product or service.”\\n\\nGoldratt talked about the mistake of isolated improvements—what he called local optima—that sacrificed what was best for the system as a whole. Another term for this is the inefficiency paradox, where optimizing the individual compo- nents of a system results in a suboptimal system.\\n\\nIn his book Free, Perfect, and Now, Deming protégé Bob Rodin of Marshall Industries shares a meeting where a number of managers came clean about the different tricks they used to game the company’s IT system. It wasn’t that they wanted the company to fail; it was just that they were incentivized for their department to win—regardless of the consequences to other departments.\\n\\nWhen Deming wrote that managers needed to “break down barriers between departments,”5 he wasn’t speaking only about collaboration, though that’s a big benefit. He was trying to get executives to see their companies as a single entity, a cohesive system, with everyone focused on the same final out- put of an ever-higher quality product or service.\\n\\nIn Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon, the authors reveal that, at the time, the company’s maximum base salary was $160,000. The company believed an incentive-based compensation model might create short-term goals at the expense of long-term value creation. They didn’t want to incentivize employees to reach departmental milestones, regard- less of whether those milestones benefitted the whole company or not.\\n\\nI know exactly what that’s like in such a tech company. Cybersecurity specialists are often at odds with operations, business managers, and applica- tion developers. The opportunities for silo mentalities abound in these murky waters. The infamous 2017 Equifax breach that exposed the personal infor- mation of 147 million people and cost the company $5.3 billion in market cap serves as yet another great illustration. The US House of Representatives committee investigating the breach found some institutional organizational\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009202\\n\\nbarriers between the chief information security officer (CISO) and the chief information officer (CIO): the CISO didn’t report to the CIO, as you might assume she would, with both of them being responsible for the company’s tech. She didn’t even report to the CEO. The person responsible for cybersecurity of a multi billion-dollar corporation reported to . . . a lawyer.*\\n\\nWhen the breach occurred, the security officer didn’t even report it to the CIO. Why? She testified before the House committee that she couldn’t recall a particular reason.† When asked if she thought it peculiar that she, the CISO, didn’t report to the CIO, she said, “That structure was in place . . . at the time I arrived at Equifax. It was the structure that was there with the person that was my predecessor. And I knew that it was that structure going in. I didn’t question it.”6\\n\\n“I didn’t question it”: famous last words.\\n\\n#10: No Slogans\\n\\n“Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the workforce.”\\n\\nMy jaw nearly dropped the first time I read Deming’s Point #10: he could have written it the day before I arrived at my new company, it was so relevant! In one of the early startups I worked for, whenever the CEO returned from a business trip, he would have a new set of motivational posters that he would plaster all over the halls. Another time, he bought us each a copy of Nassim Taleb’s busi- ness book Antifragile, thinking it would somehow solve all our problems.‡ This CEO was operating from the old deterministic model of management, trying to offer simple solutions to complex problems.\\n\\nTo this day, plenty of executive managers still don’t understand the nature of the digital world and demand “zero defects” or “never fail” software. Dr. David Woods, Professor of Cognitive Systems Engineering and Human Systems Integration and founder of Adaptive Capacity Labs, introduced me to the idea\\n\\n† To my mind, this was because the company had institutionalized the path of communication: she ran the problem up the flagpole. It wasn’t her fault the flagpole had been set up wrong to begin with.\\n\\nSpecifically, the chief legal officer.\\n\\n‡ I tweeted that I thought it was a bad idea. Nassim Taleb tweeted back that I was an idiot. I wore\\n\\nit as a badge of honor. At least, until I found out he calls everyone an idiot on Twitter.\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009203\\n\\n“Maginot Line thinking.” After World War I, France created an impenetrable line of fortifications and defenses stretching roughly from Luxembourg to Basel, Switzerland. Why? Because this was how the Germans had invaded France in World War I. A few years later, their preparations served their purposes: the Ger- mans could not break the Maginot Line. So instead, Hitler went north through Belgium and conquered France that way. Maginot Line thinking is when you expend considerable resources in an effort to counteract a past threat.\\n\\nDr. Woods said this mentality is common in cybersecurity, where exec- utives want to spend prodigious sums of money in a vain effort to counter vulnerabilities that have already been exploited. It’s the digital equivalent of locking the barn after the horse has escaped. He described cyberattacks like parasitic, biological intrusions. Human beings will never be able to rid the world of viruses; it’s a fool’s errand. We can’t stop them; we can’t control them. What we can do is be as resilient as possible, i.e., good hygiene, healthy diet, exercise, regular medical checks, etc. The same for cybersecurity: we’ll always have security vulnerabilities. That’s a fact of digital life. What we can do is be as resilient an organization as possible.\\n\\nStanford professor Martin Cassado redefined networking and security in 2007 by means of his startup, Nicara. He challenged the security industry’s status quo by pointing out that organizations spend 80% of their resources protecting the organization’s “digital perimeter” keeping the bad guys out. Man- agers want impenetrable fortresses protecting their IT systems. As we already discussed, the reality is that many breaches come from inside the network. (Think back to that bank hacker who waltzed through the side door and found an empty cubicle.) He said the security industry should assume that hackers will gain access to the system. That is, instead of trying to keep hackers out, we should plan for the inevitability of them getting in. Cassado said organizations should develop more inner perimeter security measures. Software is simply too complex and evolving too quickly to defend the Maginot Line forever.* Simple slogans won’t solve our problems. Never have. Never will.\\n\\n#11: Quality, Not Quotas\\n\\n“Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute lead- ership. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.”\\n\\nFor my Trekkies out there: prior to Nicara, Martin worked for the NSA after 9/11 on what I\\n\\ncall a Kobayashi Maru project. From that experience, he created software-defined networking (SDN). Today, he’s a partner at Andreesson Horowitz, the ventue capital firm famous for investing in Airbnb, Lyft, Pinterest, and Github, among others.\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009204\\n\\nDeming hated management by objective, results, quotas, numerical goals, and other such measures that oversimplified quality craftsmanship into neat little numbers managers could understand. Too often, managing by hard numbers sacrifices quality. When organizations care more about numbers than quality, they incur enormous costs.\\n\\nI’ve seen this over and over again in the tech industry. Take one metric for example: KLOC, or defect per thousand lines of code. One KLOC is considered good: out of a thousand lines of code, there was only one bug or error. From a deterministic perspective, it’s logical to want that number to be as close to zero as possible—100% clean code. Therefore, you would always want that number to be going down.\\n\\nHowever, there are ways to improve the quality of software code that would make that metric rise. The software development team might decide to optimize its code base, perhaps deleting unused code or writing more effi- cient code, with the overall result being fewer lines of code. With less code, the remaining defects might result in having a higher KLOC. So, although the block of code is higher quality, the team would get penalized because it resulted in a higher KLOC. Well, obviously that’s an incentive to stick with the status quo. Great-looking metric; status quo quality. This could be why Knight Capital’s old Power Peg program hadn’t been deleted off the eighth server. Who knows?\\n\\nOn the other hand, you could have a team of developers who write code that’s hard to read and maintain. The team’s KLOC can’t measure that facet of low-quality code; the team is rewarded for writing what is essentially a lot of dense code. Or like trying to reach a page count for a high school paper, the team might pad the code with unnecessary extra lines, resulting in a lower KLOC. Bad code; great-looking performance. This point flows right into the next:\\n\\n#12: No Barriers to Pride\\n\\n“Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of work- manship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, inter alia, abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objective.”\\n\\nIn his 1993 book, The New Economics, Deming wrote, “The aim of anybody, under the merit system, is to please the boss. The result is destruction of morale. Quality suffers.”7\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009205\\n\\nSomeone once asked Deming how he would change the merit system.\\n\\n“Change it!?” he thundered. “Abolish it, for the love of God!”\\n\\nHe admonished managers to remove the barriers that robbed people of pride in their work. Deming believed—and study after study supports his belief—that, in general, people want to do good work. They want to be proud of what they do and what they have accomplished. Company practices, processes, and culture get in the way of that, demoralizing them.\\n\\nFor instance, I once consulted for a CIO on a project where a large bank had been acquired by an even larger bank. For part of it, I interviewed several developers in the bank being purchased. One woman I talked to was moving an older application over from their on-site servers into the acquiring bank’s cloud infrastructure. She expressed her frustration that the acquiring bank demanded so many regulatory controls before they would allow her to deploy the soft- ware application on their cloud servers. When she asked why she couldn’t use a certain feature or process of theirs, they could never explain why; she just couldn’t. On the other hand, her bosses at the bank being bought were scream- ing at her about overdue delivery times. She couldn’t move the application until it met certain requirements, but the acquiring bank could never tell her what was needed or why. Ironically, the bank couldn’t explain their controls because they had never deployed this type of application. That is, they were requiring controls they themselves didn’t even know how to administer. Trapped in this digital Catch-22, I asked how she dealt with it.\\n\\n“It’s simple,” she said. “I write crappy code and make them both happy.” This was a developer who otherwise took pride in her work. But the work environment she found herself in wouldn’t allow her to write great code. She outright admitted it was shoddy workmanship. But caught between a rock and a hard place, she had to do what she had to do to survive and please her superiors.\\n\\nWere he here, Deming would read those managers the riot act.\\n\\n#13: A Self-Learning Organization\\n\\n“Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.”\\n\\nIn his Harvard Business Review article “Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Pro- duction System,” Dr. Steven Spear reveals the findings of his and his colleagues’ four-year study. The problem, they say, is that companies try to copy Toyota’s methods. What they should really do is understand Toyota’s mentality: “We found that, for outsiders, the key is to understand that the Toyota Production System creates a community of scientists. Whenever Toyota defines a specifi- cation, it is establishing sets of hypotheses that can then be tested.”8 Applying\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009206\\n\\nthe scientific method in order to arrive at empirical knowledge—this is one of the four core principles of Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge, the theory of knowledge.\\n\\nIn other words, Toyota found a way for its employees to teach themselves. There is absolutely a place for top-down learning, where the organization teaches an individual. But more importantly, the organization needs to be a place where people can teach themselves.\\n\\nGoogle’s infamous “20% time” was an incredibly innovative way to achieve this. Google encouraged their people to perform self-directed experiments. It resulted in Gmail, Google Maps, and Google’s cash cow AdSense. Around 2006, Cristophe Bisciglia, a senior engineer, was interviewing potential employees when he realized that even the brightest applicants were unaware of a new style of programming that Google had invented, which was ultimately the genesis of Hadoop, the software used to create the New York Times’ TimesMa- chine we discussed earlier. Bisciglia decided to use his own 20% time to create a class called “Google 101” for his alma mater, the University of Washington. IBM noticed this class and helped Google promote it throughout some of the most prestigious universities in the US, from MIT to Stanford to Berkeley. This course, probably more than anything else, would lead to the birth of the Big Data movement.\\n\\nWhen Shannon Lietz was at Intuit, she ran a sixty-person group of inter- nal hackers called a Red Team. Their primary aim was to find vulnerabilities in Intuit’s software like QuickBooks and TurboTax. As soon as her Red Team was able to breach the software’s security, they would immediately alert the developers of that software with an email that’d say something like, “Hey, we just captured ten million customer names, phone numbers, and social security numbers. Here’s the vulnerability. Please fix ASAP.”\\n\\nWhen I related this story in a presentation to one of the largest banks in the world, an executive said, “Oh, Intuit can do that kind of thing. We can’t.” I pointed out that Intuit could justify that size of an internal cybersecurity team with the company having just $15 billion in asset holdings. This bank, on the other hand, had something in the neighborhood of $2.5 trillion in assets at the time. I didn’t see how they couldn’t justify having their own Red Team.\\n\\nAndrew Clay Shafer says, “You are either a learning organization or you are\\n\\nlosing to one that is.”\\n\\n#14: Transformation Is for Everyone\\n\\n“Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody’s job.”\\n\\nCHAPTER 19: OUT OF THE CYBER CRISIS\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009207\\n\\nAccording to Deming, the commitment to continuous process improvement wasn’t an activity an organization could assign to a special task force or a par- ticular role. It wasn’t a project or one-off event. It was an all-encompassing mentality that must be embraced by everyone in the organization, starting with the CEO and diffusing through every layer and level.\\n\\nAs I’ve studied Deming, I’ve come to realize that he chose his words quite carefully. When he titled the chapter containing these 14 Points “Principles for Transformation of Western Management,” he truly meant a transforma- tion. In business, the word transformation gets bandied about a lot, but Deming selected this word with care. It means a thorough or dramatic change.\\n\\nOver the last two decades, we’ve seen thorough and dramatic changes in the world: socially, environmentally, and technologically. These changes require a similarly thorough and dramatic transformation if we are to survive them. No one can save us. It’s up to every one of us to save all of us.\\n\\nDeming already did his part. As he would say at the end of each lecture, “You have heard the words; you must find the way. It will never be perfect. Perfection is not for this world; it is for some other world. I hope what you have heard here today will haunt you the rest of your life. Then I have done my best.”9\\n\\nPART IV: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009208\\n\\nRecommended Reading\\n\\nTKtktktktkt tktktktk tktktktk tktktktk\\n\\nRECOMMENDED READING\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\uf06d\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009\\u2009210\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\n“About the Irma.” IrmaHotel.com.
